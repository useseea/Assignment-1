1 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 1
A chamber orchestra is performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No.
23 (2nd movement), featuring soloist, MARIA YUDINA.
2 INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 2
A small room looking into the hall. The programme director, ANDREYEV (45) leans back in his chair. Eyes closed, he “conducts” the music with a cheap fountain pen.
A technician, SERGEI, keeps an eye on dials and buttons. There's a clock and a portrait of Stalin on the wall.
The phone rings. Grudgingly, Andreyev answers.

ANDREYEV:
(snappy)
Radio Moscow. Director Andreyev. What is it?
He suddenly tenses, gesturing at the technician to turn down the music. Sergei watches him, munching on an apple.
ANDREYEV   
17 minutes?.....
He gropes manically for a piece of paper. ANDREYEV   
5...1.....
The pen doesn't work. He shakes it - no good. ANDREYEV   
(he's not)
..Yes, I'm writing it down..
He smacks the apple out of Sergei’s hand and gets him to hand over a pencil.
ANDREYEV   
.. 9?.. Was it a 9, like 'fine' or a 5 like....
(gestures to Sergei)

SERGEI:
..hive?

ANDREYEV:
Hello?... Hello?
They've gone. He hangs up. He's in a state.

SERGEI:
Who was it?

ANDREYEV:
The Secretariat of the... General Secretariat. The General Secretariat's.. the General Secretary’s Secretaria...

SERGEI:
(interrupting)
...Stalin?!
Sergei turns away. He's not getting involved.

ANDREYEV:
I'm to ring back in exactly 17 minutes. 17 minutes from the start or the end? How long did I talk for? HOW LONG?
3 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 3
Some of the audience are lost in the music. A NERVOUS MAN glances at an NKVD GUARD looking at him.
Trying to hide his panic, the nervous man looks away then back to the guard... who waves coyly. A woman sat next to him waves back. The nervous man heaves a sigh of relief.
4 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 4
We're on a large portrait of Stalin: handsome, strong, sleek dark hair. We pan down to see the real STALIN - frail, old, grey hair - at his desk. His frail fingers search through lists of names as the Mozart concerto plays on his radio.

Humble decor:
A short, stocky man with cold eyes behind a set of pince-nez stands on the other side of the desk. This is BERIA.

BERIA:
I put Shteyman on the list. The writer. I know you like his stuff, but...
Stalin thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.

STALIN:
No. Keep him on.

BERIA:
(points at the next name)

Shteyman 2, his wife.
Stalin gives a tiny shrug meaning ‘yes.’
20 May 2016 Draft 10 2. BERIA   
And Shteyman 3. His brother.

STALIN:
On. Better to be sure.
Beyond Beria, through a doorway, a bulky, balding middle-aged man - KHRUSHCHEV, 59 - is entertaining two other bulky men: MALENKOV - 57, - and MOLOTOV - 70.
Khrushchev is miming an amusing war incident; people in a panic not knowing what to do with a live grenade.

KHRUSHCHEV:
..they were all jumping around like drunken whores..
5 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM/DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 5
From the auditorium, we see the window of the director's office with the figure of Andreyev pacing in frustration.
6 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 6
Khrushchev is miming a man with a grenade in his mouth.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He had this look like:
(muffled)
‘There’s a grenade in my mouth'.
Stalin signs the lists and hands them to Beria.

BERIA:
I'll have these dispatched.
7 INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 7
Andreyev stares at the clock. Time has passed; the music has moved on to a new movement.

ANDREYEV:
“It is the greatest honour...’ (he bows)
He can’t see me bow, idiot.

SERGEI:
Er, Comrade Director?
It's 10.27. Andreyev rushes for the phone, banging his hip painfully on the table. He grabs the phone and dials. The

music finishes and we hear applause. He gestures frantically to the technician to turn the loudspeaker off.
Someone answers the phone.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 3.

ANDREYEV:
Hello?... YES.
8 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 8
Stalin is on the phone, with the applause playing on the radio and the others laughing drunkenly in the other room.

STALIN:
This is Stalin.
In the background, Khrushchev is continuing his story.

KHRUSHCHEV:
So I said “You'll have to enunciate”. Then–
He mimes the grenade going off, to uproarious laughter.
9 INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 9
The applause is loud. Andreyev rushes to a cupboard.

ANDREYEV:
(stammering)
Comrade... General... How are things? Sorry... Hold on...
He gets in the cupboard. The phone cord only just reaches. ANDREYEV   
Sorry again...
10 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 10

STALIN:
(interrupting)
I want a recording of tonight's performance. I'll send someone to pick it up.
Stalin hangs up. He notices that one sheet of the list of names has been left behind. Beria comes back in.

BERIA:
(picking up sheet)
Ah. Don’t want them to miss the party, do we?
He heads back out.

20 May 2016 Draft 10 4.
11 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING - NIGHT 11
Beria divides the lists between some SENIOR NKVD OFFICERS, including DELOV.

BERIA:
(pointing to the list)
Shoot her before him but make sure he sees it. And this one. Kill him, take him to his church, dump him in the pulpit.
He's pleased with the idea. He heads back to the dacha.
12 INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 12
Some MUSICIANS sweep into the Director’s office, others are at the entrance out into the corridor.
MUSICIAN 1
...she said “I only wear them at the weekend”!
Laughter. Surprise as Andreyev steps out of the cupboard.

ANDREYEV:
Was the concerto recorded?
Was it recorded?! Say “yes” to me.

SERGEI:
Um... No.
Andreyev can barely breathe.

ANDREYEV:
Stop them leaving!
13 INT. CONCERT HALL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 13
Andreyev storms along corridor and down some stairs.

ANDREYEV:
Break their legs. Not that, but anything else.
14 INT. CONCERT HALL - FOYER - NIGHT 14
Andreyev reaches the foyer and fights against the flowing crowd and in to the hall were some musicians are packing up.

ANDREYEV:
Encore! Encore the whole bloody thing! Don’t test me, you fucking idiots. Sorry. You’re very

talented. But please go back on.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 5.
15 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 15
The audience are leaving, among them the NERVOUS MAN. He's keeping his eye on the NKVD man by the exit.
Andreyev rushes to the stage, and bangs a cymbal with a flute, knocking aside music stands to get to the front.

ANDREYEV:
(to Security)
Lock the doors! Lock the doors! (to everyone else)
Don't worry, no-one is going to get killed. But I do need you to stay!
Everyone - musicians, audience - look at him. The nervous man is sweating, terrified. Security guards block the doors. The NKVD man remains inside.
16 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 16
A sparsely furnished dining room after a long night of drinking and eating. Stalin is just sitting down at one end, filling his pipe with crumbled cigarette tobacco. Malenkov tops up everyone's glass.

KHRUSHCHEV:
You know, you put someone’s little finger in a glass of water when they’re asleep? They wet themselves.

STALIN:
What next? Place a bar of chocolate in their pocket, they’ll shit their pants?

KHRUSHCHEV:
It’s biology, chief. We did it to Polnikov in Stalingrad.
Beria joins them, picking up a tomato from the table.

BERIA:
Potato doing his war stories again? (looking at his watch,
then to Molotov)
WELL before midnight. Pay up.

Molotov gets out some cash. They've clearly had a bet.

MOLOTOV:
You're bankrupting me, Nikita. This is a capitalist conspiracy.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 6.

MALENKOV:
What became of that old dog Polnikov?

STALIN:
You want to know where fucking Polnikov is? You want to GO there?
Malenkov knows he shouldn't have asked. Beria puts his arm round Khrushchev.

BERIA:
I love that grenade story. Oh, is there one in your pocket?
Khrushchev pulls a squashed tomato from his pocket. Beria and the others laugh. Stalin too.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(laughs, camping it up)
I die for the Motherland!

MUSIC:
Under the music, everything slows down.
In slow motion, we see Khrushchev and Beria laughing at each other, like two braying animals. Khrushchev tries to wipe his hand on Beria's jacket, generating more laughter. We can just hear, at a quarter of the speed, Beria and Khrushchev calling each other 'Potato' and 'Tomato' but it sounds like grunts.
We see under Beria, the caption "Lavrenti BERIA. Head of Security Forces". And under Khrushchev, his caption: "Nikita KHRUSHCHEV, in charge of Agricultural Reform".
MUSIC OUT – Back to normal speed.
Malenkov takes another tomato from the table, desperate to be in on the joke.

MALENKOV:
Take THIS, you bastards!
He mimes pulling a grenade pin from it with his teeth. Now

doesn’t know where to take the joke. Puts the tomato down. MALENKOV   
Anyway...better get back to...

STALIN:
Time for a cowboy movie. Who’s in my posse?
Everyone tries to look excited.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 7.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Oh good, it's Stagecoach again.

MOLOTOV:
Yee-hah!
17 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 17
The orchestra are on stage. Half the audience remain. Security guards are at each door. Andreyev at the front of the stage. Maria is nearby at the piano.

SERGEI:
Half the audience have gone. The acoustic will be very dry.

ANDREYEV:
Pull people in off the streets! Fat ones, so we won’t need so many!
MUSICIAN 1, the orchestra’s joker, asserts himself. MUSICIAN 1
I could call my wife? She’d... (indicates “fat”)
...”dampen the acoustic”.
Laughter. Andreyev turns to the audience, trying to smile.

ANDREYEV:
Comrades!
A TRUMPETER plays a quick fanfare, prompting laughter. ANDREYEV   
Comrades, shut up! I have great news! Wonderful news.
MUSICIAN 1
(to Andreyev)
Are you pregnant?
The trumpeter parps. More laughter.

ANDREYEV:
Comrade Stalin... (shoots a look)
...loved tonight's concerto and would like a recording of it right away which we don't have for some reason and trust me we will look into why that happened, but meanwhile... the concerto we just played will be played by us again... Now. Please. We will record it and applaud it.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 8.
No smiling now. Some of the musicians start clapping, then the audience, security guards, a very relieved nervous man, everyone. It's a huge standing ovation, though you can just make out someone dry-heaving. When it dies we hear Maria...

MARIA:
I'm not going to do it. MUSICIAN 1
You cow hole bitch.

CUT TO:
18 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS/INT. CAR - NIGHT 18
The cars from Stalin's dacha fanning out from the main car and off on different routes across the city.
We see the list from the dacha in the hand of Delov.
We stay with one car as it passes several black militarystyle trucks and vans. NKVD men in the truck.

CUT TO:
19 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - NIGHT 19
Black marias pull up. NKVD men and Delov get out and start fanning out towards the apartment blocks.
20 EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT 20
Pan across windows. Despite terrible noises from below, not one light goes on. We think we see a slight stir in the dark at one window.
21 INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM/DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 21
Andreyev hurries Maria up the concert hall and into his office. The conductor follows them in. Through the office window, we can see the orchestra and audience watching.

ANDREYEV:
You, Joan of Arc, you want to get killed?

MARIA:
Oh, like my father “got killed”? My brother? Like THAT?
He sits her down in a chair.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 9.

ANDREYEV:
You want a family reunion in the mortuary?!
The Conductor is in the background looking unwell.

MARIA:
I won't do it. You can't force me.

ANDREYEV:
(to the conductor)
Should we get another pianist?

CONDUCTOR:
No, that's ridiculous. The sound would be entirely different. Even Stalin could...

MARIA:
“Even”.

CONDUCTOR:
(frozen in fear) No... I meant...

MARIA:
Even STALIN? Is this office bugged?

ANDREYEV:
(trying to help out)
Of course Comrade Stalin will be able to tell the difference. He's a great man, with a great ear for music.

CONDUCTOR:
Two great ears.

ANDREYEV:
The two greatest ears in the Soviet Union.
Andreyev comes close to Maria, takes her hands, pleading. ANDREYEV   
Maria Viniaminovna...

MARIA:
(of her fingers)
Don’t crush the little workers. He lets go.

ANDREYEV:
You have to play.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 10.

CONDUCTOR:
(to the unseen bug)
I didn't mean what I said...

MARIA:
(to Conductor)
So you said it then. (to Andreyev)
As God is my witness, I won't do it. The Lord will see me through.

ANDREYEV:
10000 roubles.

MARIA:
20000.

ANDREYEV:
Done.
Andreyev hurries Maria out into the corridor, followed by the conductor – who faints, banging his head on a sand bucket.
ANDREYEV   
Who put that there? What brainless fucking fire safety FUCKER put that

there?
22 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM/OFFICE - NIGHT 22
It's dark. Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov and Molotov are watching a John Wayne western.
Beyond them, Stalin stands by his desk, looking at papers. Molotov has fallen asleep, with Malenkov next to him.

BERIA:
He gets shot off his horse. (guy gets shot off horse) Yup. Adios.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(loudly, so Stalin hears)
Horses are shit, son! You should have commandeered a tank.

MALENKOV:
You know we produced 5000 T-64 tanks last year?

KHRUSHCHEV:
If I have to watch this fucking movie again, drive one over my head.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 11.

BERIA:
I can have that arranged. Ach, little sleep tonight. My men are bringing in lots of lost sheep...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Anyone we know on the list?

MALENKOV:
(admonishing)
Hey, we’re supposed to be watching Shitcoach.
They look up to see if Stalin is listening.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(quieter)
Any good ones?

BERIA:
One of his guards. Says his wife gave him some slippers to wear so he wouldn't make any noise. The old man’s convinced it’s so he can creep up on him in his sleep and kill him.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Where will it end? Are we arresting anyone with feet?
Malenkov laughs.

BERIA:
Nikita. I’m having a man shot for “acquiring slippers”. Never joke about something so serious.
Stalin comes towards them.

MALENKOV:
(loudly, to alert Molotov)
Ah, you're just in time for the Red Indian attack.
He does a loud, clumsy hand-over-mouth war cry. Molotov wakes and panics.

MOLOTOV:
He.. the horse.. I was.. thinking.. important.

MALENKOV:
You were asleep.

MOLOTOV:
No. Focussed... on the soundtrack.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 12.
He yawns, and we go into slow motion again. Dramatic MUSIC Again.
Under Molotov, the caption: "Vyacheslav MOLOTOV. Foreign Secretary".
Under Malenkov, laughing, is "Georgy MALENKOV. Deputy General Secretary".
Back to normal speed.

BERIA:
(to Molotov)
You'll soon have plenty of time to sleep, comrade.
He turns to the others. A look of enigmatic menace.
23 INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 23
Men in nightshirts are marched out of doorways by NKVD.

CUT TO:
24 EXT. MOSCOW APARTMENTS - NIGHT 24
Men and women in their nightclothes led into vans by NKVD.

CUT TO:
25 INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT - ROOM - NIGHT 25
BORIS BRESNAVICH and MRS BRESNAVICH are asleep. There's a loud banging at the door. They switch on the light, terrified.

MRS BRESNAVICH:
Don't open. Don't open it!...

BRESNAVICH:
They'll kick it down...
Mrs Bresnavich goes to the window and sees A MAN being led away by NKVD OFFICERS. She starts to cry.
Bresnavich has pulled on a dressing gown and slippers over his pyjamas. The couple hug and kiss like people who know they may never see each other again.
BRESNAVICH   
I love you...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 13.

MRS BRESNAVICH:
(distraught)
Oh my God, your things.... He clasps her hands.

BRESNAVICH:
Say whatever you have to say to them. Say it. It doesn’t matter.
Bresnavich heads to the hallway. Through adjoining windows, he sees another MAN being led away. Still the knocking.
26 INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 26

Bresnavich opens the door to a friendly-looking CONCERT DIRECTOR in a dinner suit. In the hallway, two people are being led away.
CONCERT DIRECTOR
Comrade. Deepest... (he bows)
Radio Moscow requests your presence immediately. Please. You’re Moscow’s finest and... nearest conductor.
(a little desperate) We must hurry.
27 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING - NIGHT 27
Beria, Khrushchev, Molotov and Malenkov are walking together to their limos, drunk, tired.

BERIA:
(to Malenkov)
Nice work mentioning Polnikov. (Malenkov impression)
"Whatever happened to Polnikov? And Trotsky, I liked him."

MOLOTOV:
"I miss the tsar"...

MALENKOV:
What is this, the Malenkov Pogrom? I’m drunk. I can’t remember.

KHRUSHCHEV:
A tip, Melanie. When you go home, get your wife to write down everything you think you said. Then in the morning you know what you're dealing with. Khrushchev’s Law!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 14.

MOLOTOV:
Good night, comrades! Long live the Communist Party of Lenin-Stalin!
Long live John Wayne and John Ford!
Molotov drives off in his limo. He waves. They wave back.

BERIA:
(does throat cutting gesture)
Goodbye, old friend. Goodbye forever.
They all register the shock.

MALENKOV:
Really?

BERIA:
Yep. On the list. It would be simpler and cheaper if they just drove straight into a river.
Sweet dreams!

CUT TO:
28 INT. CONCERT HALL - MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 28

It's fuller now:
beside more smartly dressed concert-goers. A BIG WOMAN eats pickled onions. Some are filing up to the balcony.

ANDREYEV:
(shouting at people on balcony)
You... no, YOU! Yes, keep going along! Fill it up!
The orchestra warm up. Andreyev starts clapping. The audience, ushers, Concert Director and security guards join in. Andreyev wants it louder. The audience oblige.
Maria enters, bows and takes her seat at the piano.
Andreyev keeps the applause going as Bresnavitch enters with a conductor's baton, still in his dressing gown and slippers. MUSICIAN 2
Shit. Was Chaplin busy? MUSICIAN 3
Bresnavich can't do Mozart! He has no feel for nuance.
MUSICIAN 2
He’s in his dressing gown. I’d say “nuance” is fucked.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 15.
Bresnavich turns to face the orchestra and loses a slipper.

He gropes for it with his foot as he taps his baton to begin. The orchestra starts playing, from the very beginning.

CUT TO:
29 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - BEDROOM - NIGHT 29
A MAN desperately "over-dressing" - putting layers of clothes on top of each other. He grabs a roll of money and stuffs it in his underwear. The door is kicked open to reveal NKVD men.

INTERWOVEN WITH:
30 INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 30
Khrushchev slowly, drunkenly, taking off his clothes. His wife, NINA, sits on the bed taking notes.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I joked about the farmers. Stalin laughed. I joked about the navy. He didn’t laugh.
31 INT. LUBYANKA - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 31
Beria, yawning, strolls along, cleaning his pince-nez. Behind him an NKVD guard, ILYIN walks with a crying WOMAN in her 20s.

BERIA:
I'll see you again in twenty minutes.
Beria gestures to a cell door and the guard pushes her in. Further back, another door opens and an unconscious prisoner is dragged out by 2 NKVD men. They lift the prisoner’s hand up and wave it at the other occupant in the cell - goodbye.
32 INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 32
Back with Khrushchev and Nina.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I mentioned Polnikov.

NINA:
You fool!

KHRUSHCHEV:
No, I got away with it. Then Malenkov mentioned him again, Stalin hated that.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 16.

33 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 33
A MATRONLY WOMAN desperately scrubs blood off stairs, crying.
34 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LANDING - NIGHT 34
A YOUNG MAN points some NKVD to the front door of a building with a distinctive design.
35 EXT. MOSCOW STREET - NIGHT 35
Several people are brought out of the distinctive building by NKVD and put in vans. One is a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, who clocks the young man hiding in the shadows. He knows he's to blame.
36 INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 36
A FRIGHTENED PRISONER sits on a chair in the middle of the room, hands cuffed behind his back. A door opens and Beria comes in. He stands right behind the prisoner and massages his shoulders, whispering in his ear.
37 INT. CONCERT HALL - MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 37
A serene Maria and sweating Bresnavich bring the concerto to its conclusion. There's a brief silence - relief - then applause. The Big Woman is still eating pickled onions.
38 INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT 38
Andreyev jumps and grabs the recording.

SERGEI:
Shouldn’t we check it...?
Andreyev is already running out with record.

ANDREYEV:
No time! If it’s screwed, so are you!
39 INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 39
Back with Khrushchev and Nina.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Beria did the tomato-in-the-pocket thing. Arsehole. You'll have to clean the trousers. Then... slippers...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 17.

NINA:
(looking for slippers) I think they’re...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Shh!

(swaying as he tries to get out of a trouser leg)
Oh God, what was the slippers thing? Stalin’s slippers?
Molotov’s? Fuck. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

CUT TO:
40 INT. CONCERT HALL - ENTRANCE STAIRCASE - NIGHT 40
Andreyev manically pelts down the staircase towards the NKVD men, brandishing the new record, followed by his staff.

ANDREYEV:
I HAVE IT! I HAVE IT!...
He sees Pervak ahead, waiting. Andreyev slows to a walk, he’s done his duty. The staff follow suit.
ANDREYEV   
(more low key now)
I have the recording. We needed to find a new... sleeve.
He looks down at the sleeve. It's plain and white. ANDREYEV   
A white one. Because the other one was.. blue. It looked very... shit.

PERVAK:
The delay has been logged.

ANDREYEV:
I’ve done my duty. Any “delay” is being incurred now By YOU.
A hand takes the record from him.
Maria places a folded piece of paper into the sleeve.

MARIA:
I wish to convey a special message from my heart.
Andreyev and Pervak both disapproving.

PERVAK:
I wish to convey this record to Comrade STALIN.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 18.
Pervak and Maria wrestling for the record.

MARIA:
I want Comrade Stalin to know the full intensity of my feelings for him.

ANDREYEV:
No. This is unauthorised narcissism!
He tries to retrieve the note. We can see the record bend. Pervak grabs it back.

PERVAK:
(indicates clock)
So. The item is in my possession. After a significant “delay”.
(to NKVD Officer) Log the time.
The officers turn to leave. Maria watches them go. Andreyev drops to the floor, destroyed.
41 EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 41 MUSIC.
The crowd, including the nervous man, leave. Spotting the NKVD limousine, Pervak and the other NKVD man outside the main entrance, he grimaces, turns and walks away quickly. Two NKVD MEN suddenly bundle him into a car. It's over.
42 INT. NKVD CAR - NIGHT 42
The record speeds through the city, on Pervak's lap.
The car passes some frightened people being bundled into a van. There are fewer buildings as we reach the countryside.
43 EXT. RUSSIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT 43
The car drives down a forest road.
Two barriers are lifted in front of it by Army soldiers.
44 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - NIGHT 44
The car speeds into the grounds of Stalin's dacha.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 19.
45 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - NIGHT 45
The record travels under Pervak's arm, past various soldiers. A SERGEANT and another SOLDIER stand and salute.
The door opens. A frail hand carefully takes the record.

STALIN:
What took you so long?
The door closes. The officer breathes a sigh of relief. MUSIC ends.

46 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 46
Stalin removes the record from its sleeve. Maria's note falls unseen onto the table. He puts the record on. The stylus scratches, plays. He sees the note. Opens it and reads.
Stalin laughs. Then chokes. Silently shaking, he collapses. His body convulses, he’s suffocating.
SLOW-MOTION. Title: "JOSEF STALIN, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party". As he falls, urine streams out.
We see the note fall from his hand and flutter down. We hear Maria in V/O.
MARIA (V.O.)
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. Tyrant! Murderer! You have sinned against God and against His church. You have betrayed our nation and destroyed its people. Repent. And beg for His forgiveness, while you can.
Stalin’s face hits the floor. A pool of urine spreads out.
47 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - NIGHT 47
The sergeant and soldier on guard outside hear the noise. The sergeant does a "he's drunk" gesture.

SOLDIER:
Should we... investigate?

SERGEANT:
Should you shut the fuck up before you get us both killed.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 20.
48 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 48
Stalin on the floor, twitching. The record on a loop. A bar of the concerto cuts hard into scratching, repeating again and again. They really should have checked the recording.
A puddle of urine on the rug.
49 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 49
More time has passed. The soldiers sit there, bored.
MATRYONA PETROVNA (77) arrives with tea. Knocks. The soldiers share a glance. A beat. She opens the door, enters...
50 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 50
The room’s a mess. Matryona tuts.

MATRYONA:

Comrade Stalin. How many times? You cannot drink like a young man...
She goes to scream. We cut before the sound comes out...
51 INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 51
C/U POV of Beria's face. We're a prisoner being interrogated.

BERIA:
I just need some names. Each name you give me is one less bit of you I'll cut off. Shake? Oh, you can't.
We cut wide as we hear a knock on the door. Beria, bloodstains on his shirt, stands over a beaten prisoner tied to a chair. Ilyin is in the room.
BERIA   
Enter!
SLIMONOV, an NKVD officer, enters. Someone in another cell shouts 'Long Live Stalin', before a gun shot.

SLIMONOV:
(nervous, scared of Beria) Sorry to interrupt, Comrade
Minister. It's Comrade Stalin...
Beria turns to Slimonov, who looks down at the prisoner.

BERIA:
Don't worry about him. Those ears are full of blood anyway.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 21.

SLIMONOV:
Comrade Stalin is very ill...
Beria gives nothing away. In the background, we hear another voice shout 'Long Live Stalin' followed by a shot.

BERIA:
Tell them... Beria is on his way. They are NOT to touch a thing. NOT to call anyone else. Understand?
Slimonov gives a nervous nod. BERIA   
Tell me you understand my instructions?

SLIMONOV:

I understand. Your instructions. Beria goes to leave.

BERIA:
What's your name, lieutenant?

SLIMONOV:
(very nervous) S...s...limonov, sir.

BERIA:
S...s..limonov. Be here when I g..g..get back.
Beria leaves.
52 INT./EXT. LUBYANKA - CORRIDOR/BACK YARD - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 52
Beria walks through the Lubyanka corridors with his second-incommand, KOBULOV.
In the background we see a man being carried by two NKVD, tied to a heavy wooden log.

KOBULOV:
Abramovsky is close. But weak. (off Beria’s look)
Tomorrow, maybe.

BERIA:
Have his wife moved into the next cell. Work on her until he talks. Make it...noisy.
In the background, the man and log are tossed down some stairs. We can only vaguely make it out, but enough to know.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 22.

KOBULOV:
If he doesn’t...
They go up some stairs. A GUARD brings something for Beria to sign. He signs.

BERIA:
He talks, he doesn’t talk. It ends the same way. Shame. Mrs Abramovsky has been MOST co-operative so far...
53 INT. LUBYANKA - FRONT RECEPTION - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 53

They walk to the front doors.

KOBULOV:
(chuckling)
Very loyal. Some women will do ANYTHING to get their husbands released.

BERIA:
(fondly)
Yes. And she did ‘everything’. God bless the Union for bringing me so many devoted wives who go like sewing machines.

CUT TO:
54 EXT. LUBYANKA - FRONT OF BUILDING - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 54
They’ve reached Beria’s car. Khrustalyov holds the door for him and he gets in.

BERIA:
How’s married life?

KOBULOV:
Very good, Comrade Be...

BERIA:
Watch that wife of yours. They can all go astray, you know.
(to driver) To his dacha.
The limo drives off, as a van pulls up behind.
55 INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY 55
A kitchen in a modern apartment. Khrushchev is in his pyjamas, hungover, reading Nina the notes she made.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 23.

KHRUSHCHEV:
“Grenade funny Beria tomato pocket funny slippers question mark.” Jesus, Nina, is this code?

NINA:
You woke me up to slur this

nonsense and it’s MY fault?

KHRUSHCHEV:
“Molotov C-H-H-H-H...”. Holy Hell, was I actually fucking SNORING there?
She does the throat mime. KHRUSHCHEV   
(looking out of the window)
Oh God, yes. Beria. He...
Below in the courtyard Malenkov is seen hurriedly leaving. KHRUSHCHEV   
Something's happened.
The phone starts ringing. KHRUSHCHEV   
(on phone)
Hello.... When did it..? (to Nina)
Trousers! (on phone)
I’ll be there faster than a speeding bullet!
Nina helps him haul his trousers (from the same suit as the previous day) over his pyjamas.
56 EXT. STALIN’S DACHA - PERIMETER GATE - DAY 56
The front gate is opened. Beria's car sweeps through.
57 EXT./INT. FRONT OF BUILDING/BERIA'S CAR - DAY 57
Beria’s car drives up to the building. He gets out. Soldiers salute him as he enters the building, confident, determined.
58 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 58
The Sergeant and soldier snap to attention, suppressing fear.

BERIA:
Were you on duty when he was found?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 24.

SERGEANT:
Yes, sir.

BERIA:
No-one is to come in, understood?

SERGEANT:

Yes, sir.

BERIA:
Remain at your stations.
The younger soldier is struggling to hold himself together. Beria goes inside and shuts the door.
59 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 59
Behind the door we hear a whimper as the soldier panics. SOLDIER (O.S)
Oh God...
Stalin is still on the floor. Matryona is stroking his hair.

MATRYONA:
They told me not to get a doctor.

BERIA:
You did well, Matryona Petrovna. The Central Committee will handle things now.

MATRYONA:
So you will get a doctor?

BERIA:
I AM the doctor. I'll see to everything.
She gets up and goes. He watches her shut the door, turns back to Stalin.
BERIA   
It smells like a Baku pisshouse in here. Greetings, by the way.
He kneels down, tries to reach into Stalin's trouser pocket but it's soaked with urine. He hesitates then goes for it. He pulls out a key and wipes his hand on a handkerchief.
Beria sees Maria's note, reads it and pockets it.
60 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - SMALL ROOM - DAY 60
Beria heads into an adjoining smaller private room.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 25.
He unlocks a drawer with Stalin's key. He takes out a set of keys, heads to a bookcase, opening it to reveal a safe.
He opens the safe and removes a pile of folders. He closes the safe, locks it, and returns the keys to the desk drawer. He pulls out a few files and then heads to the window with the rest. He can't open it. It's jammed shut.

He pulls up his trouser leg to reveal a knife in a sheath strapped to his calf. He tries cutting at the dried paint round the edge of the frame. The top half comes down a fraction, leaving a gap at the top.
Beria taps the window to attract Khrustalyov's attention and gestures for him to come over.
He drags over Stalin's rickety chair and clambers onto it.
61 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING - DAY 61
With Khrustalyov. Beria shout-whispers through the window.

BERIA:
Khrustalyov! Khrustalyov!
Khrustalyov hears him and rushes over.
62 INT./EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - SMALL ROOM/FRONT OF BUILDING - D6A2Y
Beria perched on the arms of the chair. He waves for Khrustalyov to get higher.
Khrustalyov clambers onto the ledge as Beria feeds the documents through the window.
Beria wobbles, falls back a little but averts disaster by pulling at the curtain. Khrustalyov can’t suppress a smile.

BERIA:
Take the papers you blockhead. Or I’ll cut your eyes out one at a time, so you can watch it happening.
63 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 63
Beria throws the remaining papers into the stove. Phew. Sits in Stalin's chair - nice. Luxuriates in it.
A KNOCK. Beria quickly kneels by Stalin, taking his hand.

BERIA:
Come in.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 26.
He realises the hand is covered in piss but has to keep hold. Malenkov walks in.

MALENKOV:
Is that... I’m guessing that’s....
He rushes over and kneels in the urine. He springs back up.

BERIA:
Yes. He’s feeling unwell. Clearly.

MALENKOV:
Oh God, he’s irreplaceable. How can we possibly... is he still...?
Malenkov indicates “alive?”. Beria nods. MALENKOV   
As Deputy General Secretary I must now take his place, and...

BERIA:
"Take his place." But you just said he's irreplaceable.

MALENKOV:
“Take his place” as in “assemble the Central Committee”. Of course.

BERIA:
Good. I was testing you. Get used to that sort of challenge. (indicates Stalin)
What next, Boss?

MALENKOV:
Well... This is a medical decision. We should get a doctor.

BERIA:
If only we hadn’t put away all those highly competent doctors. For treason. You remember.

MALENKOV:
(uncomfortable)
I do. They were plotting to poison him...

BERIA:
That’s right. You collected the evidence...

MALENKOV:
Yes I did. (a beat)
Are you still testing me?

20 May 2016 Draft 10 27. Khrushchev bursts in.

KHRUSHCHEV:
This is calamity! Calamity!
Khrushchev rushes over to the body. He kneels, just missing the piss, pressing his face into Stalin's chest. Then...
KHRUSHCHEV    NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

MALENKOV:
Jesus, Nikita!
Sobbing, Khrushchev grabs Malenkov's arm and stands up.

KHRUSHCHEV:
My friends. Comrades-in-arms...
He hugs Malenkov who also starts to cry. Beria feels he should join in the hug. It doesn't come naturally.
KHRUSHCHEV   
Which doctor have you called?

BERIA:
The subject is currently under discussion.

MALENKOV:
As Acting General Secretary, I say the Committee should decide.

KHRUSHCHEV:
But our actual General Secretary is lying there carpet-bombing the room with piss. I think he’s saying, Get me a fucking doctor.

MALENKOV:
We wait until we're quorate.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Quorate take a running fuck. The room is only 75 per cent CONSCIOUS.
Beria notices pyjama bottoms beneath Khrushchev's trousers.

BERIA:

Why are you in your pyjamas?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Because, I act, Lavrenti. Decisively, and with great speed. I don’t...
(to Malenkov)
20 May 2016 Draft 10 28. (MORE)
...hang around looking like a fucking ghost, farting out committees.

MALENKOV:
The Central Committee is important. That’s why we’re on it.

BERIA:
(to Malenkov)
I said you’d be tested. And just now you’re being tested by a shouting man wearing pyjamas. (RE pyjamas)
Got a nappy under those, too? (RE Stalin)
Too late for him!
The door is flung open by MIKOYAN, 58, well-dressed gangster type with a lit cigarette between his lips, and BULGANIN, 58, a head-down timeserver. With them is KAGANOVICH, 60: big, a bruiser, drunk.
We go into slow motion as all three try to squeeze through the door. We hear their shocked reactions slowed down.
BULGANIN/MIKOYAN/KAGANOVICH
(in slow-motion) Papa!/Comrade!/Shit!
Underneath them, the captions: "Nicolai BULGANIN. Minister for Defence"; Mikoyan: "Anastase MIKOYAN. Vice-Premier, the Council of Ministers"; "Lazar KAGANOVICH. Minister for Labour."
We go back into real time as they squeeze around the body.

KAGANOVICH:
No! I love him too much!...
Bulganin falls to his knees, sobbing. His arm finds

Kaganovich. Khrushchev puts a hand on them both. Bulganin reaches up, tugging Mikoyan’s jacket. Mikoyan hates that.

MIKOYAN:
(warning) Suit.

BERIA:
This is compelling drama, but we do need to get him into bed.
(nods at Malenkov) Take the head.

MALENKOV:
Why?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 29. KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)

BERIA:
You're Acting General Secretary.

MIKOYAN:
(round the other side)
Can’t be any heavier than my fucking heart.
Khrushchev grabs Stalin's feet. There's now too many on the non-urine side. Only Kaganovich is on the urine side.

KAGANOVICH:
Mikoyan!
He gestures for Mikoyan to go to the other side. Grudgingly, he does so.

BULGANIN:
Better. More balanced.
Malenkov doing some light stretches.

KHRUSHCHEV:
What the hell are you doing?

MALENKOV:
I have back trouble. The head's the heaviest part...

BULGANIN:
I think actually it’s the stomach and the, you know...

MIKOYAN:
Tackle?

BULGANIN:
Arse.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Can we stop haggling like a market full of fishwives and do this!
Malenkov joins the others. Khrushchev pushes Mikoyan to the upper half of the body so he has to lift near the urine.
KHRUSHCHEV    Ready. 3...2...
Malenkov joins in loudly. MALENKOV/KHRUSHCHEV
...2..1...
Khrushchev allows Malenkov to finish it alone.

MALENKOV:
...Lift!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 30.
They lift Stalin and carry him to the door, feet first.

BULGANIN:
He's a heavy man. I mean...

BERIA:
You think Stalin is...”too heavy”?

BULGANIN:
It’s a compliment. Gold’s heavy.

MIKOYAN:
You’d know. You looted enough of it, you saucy little pirate. (winks at Bulganin)

KHRUSHCHEV:
Now we're all cosy and quorate, I hereby propose we get a doctor.

They go through into...
64 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 64
We’re a way down the corridor as they manoeuvre Stalin from the office to a door opposite.

KAGANOVICH:
The best doctors are in the gulag. Or dead. Because they tried to kill Stalin. So any doctor still in Moscow is NOT a good doctor.
The Soldier and Sergeant are further down the hall, trying hard to avoid seeing what's going on.
65 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - BEDROOM - DAY 65
They get him through the door. It's a struggle.

BULGANIN:
What are people’s thoughts on getting a “bad” doctor?

MALENKOV:
What if he recovers and finds out?
Khrushchev stops so they all have to. He unconsciously gestures with Stalin's feet as he talks.

KHRUSHCHEV:
If he recovers, then we used a good doctor. If he doesn’t recover, then we didn’t but he won’t know. But if we don’t get a doctor...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 31.

MALENKOV:
People will say WE poisoned him.

MIKOYAN:
They fucking will as well.
Murmured agreement. They start moving towards the bed again.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Malenkov)
What was the name of that woman who denounced the doctors?

MALENKOV:

Timashuk.

BERIA:
Yes. Are you still in touch?

MALENKOV:
Well, we don’t go skating together.

KHRUSHCHEV:
We could get her in.

BULGANIN:
(really?)
She sounds a keen helper, but... a negative individual.

BERIA:
She's got everything we need for

this situation:
and blowjob lips.

MIKOYAN:
Well, she’s got my vote.

BULGANIN:
Yes. Let her find us some doctors.

MIKOYAN:
If it ends badly, we pin it all on Lady Sucky Sucky.

BERIA:
And we shoot her.

MALENKOV:
That would work. (to Khrushchev)
See, we’re better as a committee.
They reach the bed. Stalin's feet are over the pillows.

KAGANOVICH:
We cannot display the Father of the Nation upside down. Let's turn him.

20 May 2016 Draft 10 32.
They turn him. Stalin's head narrowly misses a bedpost.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Watch his head!

BULGANIN:
Let’s be careful! He’s not a sack of coal!

Malenkov winces:
bed, right across Mikoyan who's bent over backwards. The urine-stained trousers pass right across his face and brush his expensive clothes.

MIKOYAN:
Mind the...! Achtung, achtung!
Mikoyan is freed and Stalin's down. Khrushchev stares at Stalin in disbelief.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He looks ready now.

MALENKOV:
I need a vodka.

BULGANIN:
I need a wash.

MIKOYAN:
(re suit)
Fine weave this is. Never get it out.

KHRUSHCHEV:
My pocket is still full of tomato. Everyone leaves. Beria hangs back.
Khrushchev stops and watches Beria. He's just standing, looking at Stalin, face blank. He brings his face right up close to Stalin's, staring at him, and pokes his stomach.

BERIA:
You have a nice, long sleep, old man. I'll take it from here.

CUT TO:
66 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - BEDROOM/DINING ROOM - DAY 66
The committee members except Malenkov and Khrushchev stand round a drinks cabinet stuffed with bottles - too many of them. Bulganin struggles to pull out a bottle of vodka.
Khrushchev walks in, placing his folded pyjamas down on the table.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 33.

BULGANIN:
I feel like a midwife, ha ha! (pulls one out)

MIKOYAN:
It’s a boy!
Bulganin is filling glasses.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Remember? He made us all guess the air temperature outside? Loser sat in the snow, bare ass. Molotov... They all laugh.

KAGANOVICH:
(little girl voice)
“I’m the Foreign Secretary. Not an Emperor Penguin”.

MIKOYAN:
(little girl voice) “My cock will snap!”

KHRUSHCHEV:
(re Beria)
Careful. All these little girl voices...

BULGANIN:
Where is Molotov, by the way?

BERIA:
He's on a list. The latest list...
The laughter stops. It's a big name to be on a list.

KAGANOVICH:
What about Svetlana and Vasily? They’ll want to see their father.

BERIA:
No. I don’t want them contacted until we have a plan. We...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(interrupting)
We stand strong. We burn bright. Because if....if our Great Beacon is extinguished, if the Great Helmsman dies...

BERIA:
(interrupting back)
Stalin is not dying! Do you hear me? Stalin will never die!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 34. (MORE)
That remnant of a man there, that pathetic old lump of flesh in his piss-stained jodpers – that is not Stalin! Stalin is the Union! The Party! YOU are Stalin. I am Stalin. Understand? I am Stalin. The people are Stalin. And they will see this when we tell them. WHEN we tell them. So, don't any of you fucking say Stalin is dying! He lives!
Silence. The tension's broken by Malenkov coming in.

MALENKOV:
Timashuk’s organising the doctors. (innocently)
What did I miss?
67 EXT. MOSCOW PARK - DAY 67
MONTAGE of Moscow park exteriors: fountains.
An old man, LUKOMSKY, with his small dog on a lead.
A black maria stops. Lukomsky realises it's for him. He starts to run as best he can. Heading past the fountains. Some NKVD MEN, including Delov run to catch him. He abandons

the dog.

LUKOMSKY:
Please... I've done nothing wrong!
They catch him. An NKVD OFFICER is waiting with a doctor's white coat, a stethoscope and a doctor's bag.

DELOV:
Put this on.

LUKOMSKY:
I retired 6 years ago.

DELOV:
Put it on!...

LUKOMSKY:
I can give you names?
The NKVD men put the coat on him and open the van doors. Inside are other terrified DOCTORS, including a WEIRD-LOOKING TALL DOCTOR. LIDIYA TIMASHUK, an attractive woman of about 40 gets out the front and she and an NKVD officer chase the dog. We cut before we find out if they caught it or not.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 35. BERIA (CONT'D)
68 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/GROUNDS - DAY 68
RED ARMY SOLDIERS with dogs patrol. Others are around, and some NKVD visible in the background.
Khrushchev and Kaganovich walk along a path.

KAGANOVICH:
Poor Molotov. He loves Stalin. Stalin kills his wife. He still loves Stalin. Stalin arrests him.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Stalin told me it would be Bulganin next.

KAGANOVICH:
Really? I heard Mikoyan. God he was good.

KHRUSHCHEV:

(testing Kaganovich)
No, he was paranoid. I think he was on the point of arresting his own reflection.
Kaganovich doesn't respond. They walk in silence. Khrushchev tries again.
KHRUSHCHEV   
So. Who’ll be on the next list? (indicates “me and you”)

KAGANOVICH:
Look, nobody wants the future of the Union to be Beria and Malenkov staring at each other across a fucking graveyard. But what...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Reform. Change. We really want millions in camps? Look, we’re not the only ones worried about Beria. We should sound out Mikoyan and...

KAGANOVICH:
That’s factionalist talk, Nikita.
They stop. In the distance, Malenkov is pissing against a tree, with Beria very close to him.

KHRUSHCHEV:
You want factionalism? (points across)
Beria’s playing Melanie like a fucking musical saw...

CUT TO:
20 May 2016 Draft 10 36.
We join Malenkov and Beria by the tree. Malenkov’s pissing.

MALENKOV:
When I piss, I try to make eye contact with an officer. Ruins their day!

BERIA:
We need more security in Moscow.

Did you hear that pinhead Khrushchev undermining you about the doctors? Remember: Stalin chose YOU.

MALENKOV:
Khrushchev. Talking goat. Don’t worry, Lavrentiy. “Mother Russia” is safe in my hands...

BERIA:
You call it “Mother Russia”?
Beria indicates his penis. Malenkov laughs.
We're back with Kaganovich and Khrushchev. They walk on.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I’m pulling Stalin’s children in. Now. Keep them close.

KAGANOVICH:
Vasily will be lying face down in a ditch full of vodka. But Svetlana..

KHRUSHCHEV:
The people LOVE her. I’m getting her...

KAGANOVICH:
You heard Beria. We don’t get them on board until there’s a plan...

KHRUSHCHEV:
I just TOLD you what my...
There's a shout from the courtyard outside the house. PERVAK (OOV)
Comrade Ministers! Svetlana Alliluyeva is here!
They look up to the house. Stalin's daughter, SVETLANA ALLILUYEVA (30), is at the top of the slope next to PERVAK.

SVETLANA:
(to NKVD Officer)
Where is he? Is he OK? Who got here first? Who’s in charge here?

20 May 2016 Draft 10 37.
All four committee members start cutting across the woods. Malenkov and Beria spot Khrushchev and Kaganovich.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(shouting) Svetlana! Hello!

BERIA:
(running) Svetlana!
(to Malenkov)
They’re trying to cut you off!

MALENKOV:
(running)
What? Those bastards!

KHRUSHCHEV:
(running)
Shit, the race has started. Fucker’s halfway round the track before they've fired the pistol. (shouts)
Hello!
Malenkov trips a little and has to stop running. Beria's the first to reach Svetlana. She's been crying.

SVETLANA:
Has he said anything? Is he... is he able to speak?
Beria catching his breath, doubled over. Svetlana consoling. SVETLANA   
It’s a shock for all of us. Is Vasily on his way?
(to everyone)
Has my brother been told?
Beria sees Khrushchev is close.

BERIA:
(panting)
Svetulya... I'll take you to him..
Beria puts a proprietorial arm around her. They head to the house as Khrushchev and Kaganovich arrive, breathless.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I'm so sorry, Svetlana...
He tries to take her hand, but Beria shepherds her inside.

SVETLANA:
Someone contact Vasily! He must be here!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 38.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(shouting after her)
I’ll do it! I’ll get him! Don’t worry... darling!
(fuck no, not that) Svetlana!

BERIA:
(tetchy)
Yes, see to that could you, Comrade Khrushchev?
69 INT. ICE HOCKEY RINK - DAY 69
A training match. The players are clearly second-rate. One of them - BOBROV - is terrified. All up at one end, with three trainers lobbing at them.
Watching them, drunk and angry - VASILY DZHUGASHVILI (30), Stalin's son, in his Air Force uniform. A COACH is with him.

VASILY:
When we play Hungary, are we allowed to use guns?

COACH:
Comrade General, they're the best I could find since the plane crash.

VASILY:
Stop saying plane crash! There was never a plane crash!
Vasily watches the players scuttle around on the ice, and takes a swig from a hip flask.
VASILY   
Soviet planes do not crash, and Stalin’s son does not fuck up.

COACH:
We still have Bobrov. He wasn't on the plane.

VASILY:
What plane?

COACH:
(shouts) Bobrov!
Briefly focussed, Bobrov sweeps past the other players, then completely misses the goal. He looks to Vasily, terrified.

VASILY:
Jesus, he's petrified. He's leaving a trail of yellow ice.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 39.
A sense of other players chipping the ice or miss-hitting. VASILY   
You’re the coach. Coach them so they’re as good as the dead team was. Or I’ll have you killed. OK?

COACH:
Yes, yes.
Three NKVD OFFICERS, including TARASOV step in, watching Vasily from afar. Vasily spots them.

VASILY:
Shit... Do they know?? (shouting at the players) Play better now! PLAY BETTER!
A player crashes into the hoarding in front of Vasily.

TARASOV:
General? You are to come to your father's dacha –

VASILY:
That plane should never have taken off. You think because of who I am I can predict ice storms?
The officers share a look.

TARASOV:
Has something happened to our national hockey team?

VASILY:
No.
(indicates rink)
See? No. But ask yourself - might something happen to YOU?
The officers look over at the players, and watch one of them screw up a tackle and smash to the ground.
The NKVD men nod to each other, grab Vasily and pick him up. VASILY   
What the fuck..? My father will have you saddled and ridden to Siberia! You have no manners, you rude fucking cunts.
70 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING - DAY 70
The black maria from the park pulls into the courtyard.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 40.
Delov and the other NKVD get out and open the doors. The scared shabby doctors emerge. One is very young.
Lidiya gets out the front of the van.
71 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM - DAY 71
Beria is by Svetlana who's crying. Khrushchev offers a chair.

SVETLANA:
No, no.
Khrushchev goes to sit then thinks better of it.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He’s with good people, my dear. They’re the best...
The shamble of doctors leave the bedroom with Malenkov, and line up in front of the politburo, Svetlana and Matryona.
KHRUSHCHEV   
Beria got the doctors.

BERIA:
No, that was Malenkov.

MALENKOV:
Svetlana, would you like to sit

down?

SVETLANA:
Really. No.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(offering his chair) Have mine.

SVETLANA:
(cross)
The men always want me to sit down. NO.
Svetlana regrets her scratchy response, whispers to the men. SVETLANA   
Thank you for your concern.
Lukomsky nervously reads from a paper. Lidiya is beside him.

LUKOMSKY:
After examining Comrade Stalin we've come to the unanimous conclusion that...
(struggling to continue)
...he's...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 41.

BERIA:
(nods to Lidiya)
Please. Put him out of his misery. Lidiya takes the paper off him.

LIDIYA:
Comrade Stalin has had a cerebral hemorrhage. The right side of his body is paralyzed.

BERIA:
Does he have any chance of recovery?

LUKOMSKY:
It's, um... It's hard to say...
Beria goes right up to him, and speaks quietly, calmly.

BERIA:
Relax. I'm not going to kiss you. Will he recover? Yes. Or no.
Lukomsky manages to mouth the quietest "No" ever. BERIA   
(loud, to the others) It's over!
Shocked silence. Beria gets his hat and prepares to leave. Discretely, a few of Beria’s people (NKVD) can be seen hovering at the edge of shot, and down corridors, waiting for his signal.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Now it begins. I cry for Stalin, I cry for all of us...
Beria’s people just as suddenly disappear. Beria turns to Svetlana. She looks numb.

BERIA:
Courage, little bird. We’re here for you.
Khrushchev realises he should maybe have said this first.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Yes. Most of all, we cry for you. All Russia feels your sorrow. (awkwardly)
Little... bird.
Beria starts to leave again. His ‘people’ appear again discretely.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 42.

BERIA:
I must get back. Prepare the nation for this...trauma.

SVETLANA:
Stay with me, please. I feel alone.
Beria looks torn: he needs to go to Moscow to take control.

MALENKOV:
I could go to Moscow. I'm... now General Secretary if “he” is not... compos mentis...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(fuck you, Beria)
I’ll stay with you, Svetlana. The old man would’ve...

SVETLANA:
Oh, THANK you Comrade Khrushchev.

BERIA:
(fuck you, Khrushchev)
No, I can do things here. Here is perfect.
(to Lidiya) Timashuk. Come.
Beria’s people disappear again.
He and Lidiya leave. Kaganovich is crying into Stalin’s hand.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(quietly, to Kaganovich)
While Beria has his celebratory thirty-second fuck, I’m going to find out who our friends...are you even fucking listening?
Kaganovich nods, still sobbing.
72 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 72
Lidiya follows Beria down the corridor, past the Soldier and Sergeant.

BERIA:
(to Lidiya)
Stay here. Shut your ears.
He goes inside Stalin's office.
73 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 73
Beria shuts the door behind him and punches the air with joy,
20 May 2016 Draft 10 43.
trying hard not to scream and shout. He picks up the phone.

BERIA:
(phone)
Moscow is to be sealed off. Send in more NKVD. All army stations replaced by NKVD. And initiate the new lists.

(ends call, sotto to self) Reset your watches, ladies and gentlemen.
74 INT. LUBYANKA - OFFICE AND CORRIDOR - DAY 74
Kobulov hands a list to an NKVD OFFICER who salutes, takes it along a corridor to a SOLDIER who salutes and marches to a cell. The door’s unlocked.
A PRISONER is being interrogated. The soldier shoots him dead and leaves. The NKVD INTERROGATOR is left stunned as we hear
O.S a succession of unlocking doors, yells and gunshots.
75 EXT. STALIN’S DACHA - PERIMETER GATE - DAY 75
FIVE SOLDIERS on guard. Smoking, relaxed. An ARMY CAPTAIN watches as NKVD MEN get out of a truck. An NKVD OFFICER hands the Captain some orders. Captain doesn’t like what he sees.
One NKVD man pulls out bottles of vodka. Soldiers look to Captain, who reluctantly nods, snatch the bottles, and amble into jeeps. The army leave. The NKVD are in charge.
76 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 76
Beria opens the door. Lidiya steps in and shuts the door. He looks at her for a moment.

LIDIYA:
Over his desk? As usual?
She walks to the desk, bends over it. She's done this before.

BERIA:
Stalin is dying. And all you do is present me with your cold vagina? How shockingly, shockingly inappropriate, Lidiya.
She's surprised, shaken, but tries not to show it. BERIA   
Oh, don’t worry. You’ll be thoroughly “seen to” later...
A horrible, courteous smile. He indicates “go”. She leaves.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 44.
77 INT/EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAYS/FRONT OF BUILDING/GROUND7S7 -

DAY:
Lidiya walks downstairs and out the building. Two NKVD Officers with documents look up at her. More trucks arriving. All exits routes blocked. We see a GUARD recognise her name on a list. Lidiya runs in panic into the woods. We go with her. Beria watches from the front of the dacha.

An EXPLOSION. Guards cock their guns. Bulganin rushes out.

BULGANIN:
A mine? Are we being attacked?

BERIA:
(shrugs)
Perhaps an animal. (to an NKVD Officer) You have your orders.
He turns and goes back inside.
78 INT./EXT - VASILY'S LIMOUSINE - DAY 78
Vasily's limo drives through the countryside.
Vasily sits between the NKVD officers in the back, drinking. No-one says anything. Then...

VASILY:
Do either of you play hockey?
79 INT. KREMLIN - STALIN'S OFFICE - DAY 79
The room is big and spartan. Simple furniture, wall maps. An outsized chess set. The lights are on.
The locked door CRACKS as an NKVD OFFICER forces entry. A SENIOR NKVD OFFICER enters, switches off the light.
80 EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY 80
From across the square, we see the light go out.
81 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 81
KHRUSHCHEV steps in. It's dark; the curtains are shut.
He checks the safe: it's locked. He looks on the desk, opens a couple of drawers.
SVETLANA (O.S.)
I have every right to be here!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 45.
Khrushchev jumps. He didn't see Svetlana sat in the darkness.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(Thinking of an excuse)
Your father kept some excellent vodka here.

SVETLANA:
And Vasily probably drank it. Oh, Nikita. Who can I turn to now? Mama killed herself, Papa’s dying, Vasily’s...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(relieved)
Yes! I was also looking for you to tell you that I’ve sent for Vasily!
He's not sure whether to put a comforting hand on her or not. KHRUSHCHEV   
I'm here. No matter what happens, I'll make sure no harm comes to you or your brother.

SVETLANA:
Who said anything about harm? Did someone tell you we’re in danger? Tell me!

KHRUSHCHEV:
I didn't mean...

SVETLANA:
(panicky/angry)
Who wishes harm on me?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Nobody. Nobody. Anyway, they’d have to get past ME.

SVETLANA:
People would harm the children of Stalin? Even though he’s...
She loses it. A gush of tears. Khrushchev hesitates, settles for an awkward, comradely grip on her shoulders.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Your father can never die. Stalin is you, Stalin is me, Stalin is the Union.. so cannot die!

SVETLANA:
What are you saying? He’s dying.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He is dying...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 46.

He casts his eyes down, spots a bottle, grabs it. KHRUSHCHEV   
Svetlana, just...be strong. And... (out of platitudes)
Try not to be afraid.

SVETLANA:
I wish I knew what not to be afraid of.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Nothing. Trust me.
An awkward double-fisted “be strong” sign. He hurries out.

CUT TO:
82 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM/BEDROOM - DAY 82
A vast buffet is added to by a CHEF covered in medals. There are empty vodka bottles everywhere. Smoke hangs in the air. Beria is idly playing billiards, watching a YOUNG WAITRESS. He whistles her over, takes a large tomato from her plate. He bites into it, keeping eye contact. Juice runs down his chin. Kaganovich is near the bed, drinking. Mikoyan’s on the other side of the room with Malenkov, whose hair is over-groomed.

MIKOYAN:
You had your hair fucking embalmed or something?

MALENKOV:
Fuck you. There'll be a lot of photos. I can’t let him or the Party down.
Khrushchev walks in with the vodka, annoyed with himself. He goes to the bed and tries to take part of Stalin's hand.
There are only fingers left; Kaganovich is holding the rest.

KAGANOVICH:
(quietly)
Did you speak to Svetlana?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(indicates bottle)
Went very well. She gave me this. (off Kaganovich’s look)

A good sign. Vodka’s ALWAYS a good sign.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 47.

KAGANOVICH:
You’re right. Beria’s taking over. Another 9 NKVD divisions in Moscow. More on the way. Army’s out.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He's moving fast. Bulganin comes in.

BULGANIN:
Got to unload to reload.

KHRUSHCHEV:
You have the bladder of a sparrow.

BULGANIN:
But the penis of a horse.
Nobody laughs. Mikoyan has joined Beria.

MIKOYAN:
(to Bulganin)
You ARE the penis of a horse. (to Beria)
Tough old bastard. Thought he’d just kick Death in the balls.
Beria puts a reassuring arm round Mikoyan's waist.

BERIA:
My friend.
Mikoyan pulls a crushed tomato from his jacket pocket. He looks angry, volatile.

MIKOYAN:
Piss and tomato AND Stalin dying. This is a nightmare.
Beria’s about to apologise. Mikoyan waves it away, heads out. Lukomsky enters with two other doctors, who wheel a hefty piece of equipment with a very squeaky wheel.

MALENKOV:

Who ordered the Wurlitzer?

LUKOMSKY:
It's... it's a respirator... American...

KAGANOVICH:
(gobsmacked)
You brought a capitalist machine... in here?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 48.

DOCTOR:
He brought it. It's from his hospital!...

LUKOMSKY:
It was his idea...
Khrushchev joins Beria and Malenkov while Kaganovich berates the doctors.

KHRUSHCHEV:
So, you had time at your hairdresser’s to mobilise the NKVD?

MALENKOV:
What?

BERIA:
I did it. Look, people will need... (makes fist)
...reassurance.

KHRUSHCHEV:
So why switch the lights off in Stalin's office at the Kremlin?

BERIA:
What?

MALENKOV:
Ah... I know what happened. I asked for the place to be secured, and the dolts have turned the lights

off.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Why not tether an airship above Red Square with “HE’S DEAD” painted on it?

KAGANOVICH:
Take this Uncle Sam shit away! (unplugs the machine)

SVETLANA:
He can't breathe!..
Svetlana grabs the plug and puts it back in.

BERIA:
(puts cigarette in his mouth)
It's a good thing he can breathe. We're all agreed on that.
Malenkov checks no-one is looking and quickly heads out.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 49.
83 EXT. RED SQUARE - SQUARE IN FRONT OF STALIN'S OFFICE - DAY 83
The same long shot as before. This time the light turns on.
84 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 84
Later. Beria is having a cigarette in the hallway. Suddenly there are cheers from inside the room.
85 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - BEDROOM - DAY 85
Beria hurries in. The committee and Svetlana are around the bed, weeping, laughing, holding Stalin's hand.

KAGANOVICH:
A miracle! Stalin is invincible!

MALENKOV:
The Man Of Steel! He lives!

MIKOYAN:
The Boss is back!

BERIA:
What? What's happened?
Stalin's eyes are open. Beria moves the others out of the way and takes pride of place right by Stalin's head.

BERIA   
That’s impossible! And wonderful! Long live the Union!
Stalin meets Beria's eye. Then points at Khrushchev.

KAGANOVICH:
Maybe he's appointing a successor?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(a little bit pleased) Do you think?

STALIN’S POV:
members. The finger stops, points to Matryona.

KAGANOVICH:
Maybe not.
He points past her, to the wall. They all turn to look at a painting of a young girl feeding a lamb through a bottle.

MALENKOV:
Maybe he's saying: "I am like this lamb and you, my children, have given me life."
20 May 2016 Draft 10 50.

KHRUSHCHEV:
No. Stalin’s the GIRL, nourishing the Lamb - the Union - with Marxism- Leninism.

SVETLANA:
My father is not a girl!

MALENKOV:
He’s the milk!

MIKOYAN:
YOU’RE the tit.

BULGANIN:
Maybe he just wants a drink...
Everyone agrees. Matryona offers him some water.
Stalin lowers his hand. Beria goes to Lukomsky, cowering at

the back. He shakes the doctor's hand but doesn't let it go.

BERIA:
You are a hero, Comrade Lukomsky.

LUKOMSKY:
(terrified)
I... Sometimes this happens... And... I'm incredibly pleased.

BERIA:
I won't forget it.
Beria glares at him - it's a death sentence - then leaves.
86 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 86
Beria paces. Agitated, defeated. For the first time, we see him troubled.

BERIA:
(sotto, to self)
Live, or die. This is just... dithering.
The original soldier and sergeant are still there, exhausted.

SOLDIER:
Sir, we have remained at our post as you ordered. Might we respectfully...
Beria turns round to look at them but.. MIKOYAN (O.S.)
He’s dead!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 51.
Beria’s brief smile. He notes the sergeant has spotted it. Beria darts back inside.

CUT TO:
88 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 88
We hear a loudspeaker voiceover as Beria walks. ANNOUNCER (O.S)
The Presidium of the Supreme Soviets of the USSR announce with

deep grief that on March 5th at 6.50pm Josef Vissarionovich Stalin...
89 EXT. GULAG - PRISON YARD - TWILIGHT 89
A brutally cold, frozen, rugged environment. Low, stone buildings.
PRISONERS listen, shocked; many upset. One of them is the Nervous Man from the concert. NKVD GUARDS look to each other. ANNOUNCER (O.S)
...Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party..
90 INT. KREMLIN - STALIN'S OFFICE - DAY 90
An NKVD man munching on a salami, burning papers in a bin.
91 EXT. RED SQUARE - SQUARE IN FRONT OF STALIN'S OFFICE - DAY 91
The same long shot as before. This time the light turns off. ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Chairman of the Council of Ministers, has died after a serious illness....
92 INT./EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - OUTHOUSE/SIDE OF DACHA - DAY 92
We see Stalin’s dead face, filling the screen.
A small medical saw is seen starting to cut into the skull.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 52.
Wide to see we’re in an outhouse near the dacha. A doctor cutting into Stalin’s head with an intense grinding noise. Laboratory and medical equipment surrounded by spare tyres, car engine etc. Stalin's body is laid out. Lukomsky and the doctors, NKVD OFFICERS and committee members are there.
MIKOYAN/MALENKOV/KAGANOVICH/KHRUSHCHEV
/BULGANIN
(wincing)
NOOO!/Fuck my boots!/Whoa!...

MIKOYAN:
Sorry, boss! I wish I could take it for you!

BERIA:
(to Malenkov)
We need to think about the Presidium!

MALENKOV:
(reacting to the body)

Yes. God. Succession. The Committee should. Oh. Fuck. Notify. No.
That’s his... must we see this?

BERIA:
Regrettable! But important this happens quickly! Transparency!
The double doors at the front of the outhouse are hauled open. It's Vasily, drunk.

VASILY:
What are you doing to my father, you jackals!
The very young doctor is peeling back skin on Stalin's skull. VASILY   
Murderers! You'll kill him!
Beria gestures to the others: he'll deal with this.

BERIA:
Vasily, your father is dead and... Vasily draws his pistol.

VASILY:
Dividing the spoils? Leave his brain alone! How old are you?
Beria nods at the NKVD. An NKVD man tries to grab Vasily's gun but he fires it.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 53.
Everyone dives for cover. Malenkov runs out of the door and pulls it shut. Bulganin and Khrushchev try to follow but Malenkov's holding it shut from the other side. Khrushchev crouches against the door. Mikoyan stands fearless.
NKVD men try to subdue Vasily. He struggles, firing his gun. VASILY   
Here is your fucking... harvest!
They drag him away from Stalin but he fires more shots. They hit Stalin. His head rocks forward as if the shots have jolted him into life for a moment.
The NKVD get his gun off him. We hear Svetlana's voice. SVETLANA (O.S.)
Vasily! Vasily! Stop!...
She's come into the garage. Her voice stops him struggling.

VASILY:

Tiny child doctors are cutting up Papasha! They're filling his brain with American lies!
She grabs his face, looks right into his eyes.

SVETLANA:
(very quiet)
He’s gone, Vasya. Just you and me now. Be careful. Remember what Papa said. Wade gently across the river because...
(rhythmically digging into his face)
It. Is. Full. Of. Snakes. And. Crocodiles.
Vasily nods. He's heard her. Svetlana looks at the NKVD men.

VASILY:
(trying to act normal)
Someone could have told me what to expect. Next time, tell me.
Beria nods to the NKVD, who let him go. Malenkov opens the door and comes back in.

BULGANIN:
(to Malenkov)
I understand wanting to leave. But why hold the door shut? Who does that?

VASILY:
Cover me, I’m getting Papa!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 54.
Suddenly, Vasily grabs for his gun. Malenkov immediately closes himself outside again.

MIKOYAN:
(to Malenkov)
Off you go, kitten!
The NKVD men struggle with Vasily, force him to the ground and sit on him. It's not dignified. Svetlana looks ashamed.

SVETLANA:
(close to Vasily)

Moron. I’m not part of your suicide pact. You want to die? Shoot yourself.

VASILY:
You will regret this! You are sitting on fire! Fire!

BERIA:
He's distressed. We all are. (to doctors)
Is it done?
One of the petrified doctors nods. BERIA   
It is finished. Let's go. And someone do something about all of this –
(waves vaguely at Stalin)
– then take it to the Kremlin.

SVETLANA:
Where now for me? And my brother?

BERIA:
My men will bring you to Moscow.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I would be honoured to escort you.
Svetlana senses Beria’s antipathy to Khrushchev.

SVETLANA:
Thank you. But no, I’ll go with Beria’s men.
Beria kisses her and marches out into the courtyard.

BERIA:
Our precious cargo. (shouting) Khrustalyov! My car!
The other committee members look at each other for a beat, then rush off after him. Suddenly everyone's in a hurry.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 55.

BULGANIN:

We need equilibrium. Soon.

MIKOYAN:
“Equilibrium”, bollocks. Give me chaos every time. Got more meat on it.
93 EXT./INT. DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/BERIA'S CAR - DAY 93
Beria arrives at his limo. Khrustalyov opens the door and he gets in. An NKVD officer is in the driver seat, Khrustalyov stays outside. He nods to his boss and heads into the dacha. Inside the car, the young waitress Beria saw earlier is cuffed to the car door. She's frightened. He smiles at her.

BERIA:
I know. Sad times.
The car starts but the courtyard’s a logjam of vehicles all trying to get out. Other committee members hurry to their vehicles, drivers holding open the doors for them. Svetlana heads with an NKVD man to her limo. Horns start to blare.
Political manoeuvering. NKVD men trying futilely to direct. Then, in the chaos, NKVD men emerge carrying a plain wooden coffin. They load it onto the back of a truck and climb in. Beria gets out of his car. Stands solemnly. The others are obliged to get out and show their respect. The NKVD clear a path for the truck and escorts. Beria’s car following. He’s won the scramble.
The others start their cars. Horns blaring, cars jostling...
94 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/ROAD - DAY 94
The last of the limos drive away. An empty road. Silence. Then - a rumbling, getting nearer. A CONVOY of NKVD trucks coming up the road, through the gates, into the courtyard. Armed NKVD MEN pour out, occupying the house and grounds. Kobulov barks into a loudhailer.

KOBULOV:
Comrades! We share your grief! You will assemble in the courtyard for further instructions!
95 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY 95
Busts, portraits, furniture, files, are removed, and medical equipment from the outhouse. Stalin's turntable, the record still on it, is loaded into a box, nailed shut.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 56.
Some STAFF are already in a line in front of the house,

others are brought out by the NKVD, including the chef and the doctors. Some have belongings, some nothing. A lot of orders are being shouted. People are frightened, confused.
A supposedly dead Stalin, in a dressing gown and slippers, is marched out. The chef turns to his confused neighbour.

CHEF:
His lookalike. I think his contract just ran out.
The LOOKALIKE is taken round the corner to be shot. But the SOLDIER executioner can’t do it. Looks like HIM. Someone quickly throws a cloth over the lookalike’s head. Good. Bang. A second lookalike is marched out. Another, third lookalike, clearly a younger, fitter man, makes a break for it. Close up of a young, fit Stalin running for his life away from the dacha. But we cut away before any mine explosion. In fact, the explosion doesn't come...
96 INT/EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - KITCHEN/FRONT - DAY 96
Delov and Two NKVD OFFICERS search the kitchen. They discover Matryona, crouched between two gas stoves, her eyes shut.

DELOV:
Hey, you! On your feet!
Matryona is hauled up and dragged out the front door.
Now we hear and just about see a mine explode in the woods.
97 INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 97
The soldier and sergeant are asleep. Khrustalyov appears with Pervak.

PERVAK:
Attention!
The soldiers dozily comes to attention.

KHRUSTALYOV:
At ease. You can stand down now. There's food in the kitchen.

SERGEANT:
Thank you, sir.
They head down a long corridor with a kitchen at the end. Then the sergeant comes back into view, collapsing to the floor, unconscious. NKVD arms reach into the doorway framing our view and drag him out.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 57.

The other soldier runs across the doorway followed by two NKVD MEN. It's messy. The soldier may have gotten away into the woods. We don’t know.
98 EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/GROUNDS - DAY 98
Loaded trucks pull out of the courtyard.
We are with Matryona as the truck moves off. From her pov we see Khrustalyov join Kobulov in the courtyard. They get smaller and smaller in the distance. Kobulov shoots Khrustalyov in the head. Other landmines go off.

CUT TO:
99 INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT/MALENKOV'S APARTMENT - EARLY 99

EVENING:
Khrushchev is chopping vegetables. A tired Bulganin is sat at the kitchen table.

KHRUSHCHEV:
So... Beria's introduced 'special measures' to 'reduce the panic'? Carrots.
He looks at Bulganin, meaningfully, as if sounding him out. Bulganin passes him a couple of carrots.
KHRUSHCHEV   
It's good to prepare, get everything ready.
He looks at Bulganin, meaningfully, as if sounding him out.

BULGANIN:
Are we talking about Beria or the stroganoff?
Khrushchev goes over to his washing machine.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I built a big factory making these.
Khrushchev turns it on. It makes a terrifyingly loud noise.

BULGANIN:
(shouting over it)
If Russia was a noise, then that would be it.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Not so good for washing clothes.

Very useful for “conversations”..about Beria.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 58. A pause.

BULGANIN:
Look, it's important someone takes control.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Someone like Beria?
The conversation is suddenly significant. Bulganin comes up to Khrushchev so they can talk quietly.

BULGANIN:
It should certainly be someone who has the support of all parts of the party.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Like Beria?

BULGANIN:
Well certainly one of us.

KHRUSHCHEV:
So... maybe not Beria?

BULGANIN:
You’re very good with that knife. It’s ...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(interrupting)
I'm saying... maybe not be Beria... We should get rid of him.

BULGANIN:
Yes. Yes! And soon! Punish him! Stick him in a room with twelve big hungry, horny Serbians!
Suddenly the washing machine comes to a juddery stop, interrupting Bulganin. The men stare at one another in panic. Khrushchev tastes a spoonful of food, not yet ready to eat.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Mmm. That is good. Delicious.
The machine starts again. Khrushchev spits out the food. KHRUSHCHEV   
Feh! Raw!

BULGANIN:
We should take acting classes. If Stalin hadn't killed all the actors.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 59. (MORE)
Look, I want to come on board, but we don't have the numbers.
Suddenly the phone rings. Has someone been listening in? Tentatively Bulganin answers as Khrushchev adds some of the vegetables to a pot on the stove.
We see Malenkov, Mikoyan standing next to him, by the window of his apartment.
MALENKOV (ON PHONE)
Are you being factional?

BULGANIN:
We're cooking some food. Khrushchev grabs the phone.

MALENKOV:
I can see you, you know.
We cut to reveal the two apartment windows look on to each other, very close in distance. We see Khrushchev in one window, Malenkov in the other.
MALENKOV   
Looks like factionalism to me.
Khrushchev grabs a spoonful of stew and stands at the window theatrically eating it.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Tastes like lamb stroganoff to me. Khrushchev hangs up.

MALENKOV:
Listen, I'm acting secretary general and I'm – oh, he's gone.

MIKOYAN:
Jesus, squeal any higher and you'll burst your hymen.

MALENKOV:
They’re being factional

MIKOYAN:
So are we.

MALENKOV:
I’m Acting General Secretary. How can I be plotting against myself? Khrushchev closes the blinds.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 60. BULGANIN (CONT'D)

KHRUSHCHEV:
On the committee it’s you, me, Kaganovich. Three against three. But there’s also Molotov.

BULGANIN:
But he’s on the... (mimes “headshot”)
...list.

KHRUSHCHEV:
We tell him - Beria put him there. Beria killed his wife. Molotov’s revenge gets us FOUR.
Khrushchev goes through to another room, and peers outside through a window. His POV: in a different block to Malenkov's, Molotov stares out of his window, grief-stricken. KHRUSHCHEV   
(epiphany)
He’s at home. I’d better get over
there before Beria and his sausagefaced clowns do....
The washing machine stops again. KHRUSHCHEV   
(furious, to the machine) You piece of metal shit!

(to Bulganin)
Look after the food...
He rushes off, full of urgency.

BULGANIN:
What do I do? Add salt, right? That's what people who can cook do.
We hear Khrushchev shouting back as he goes. KHRUSHCHEV (O.S.)
Recipe book's under the sink!
100 EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING 100
Khrushchev hurries down the stairs, out across the courtyard to Molotov's stairwell opposite. The elevator’s at the second floor and rising. He's out of breath but he’s on a mission.
He takes the stairs.
101 INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - EARLY EVENING 101
Prisoner POV of Beria's face. He's close again. Too close. He's quietly singing a traditional Russian folk song.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 61.

BERIA:
"In a field a birch tree stood..." No? Come, your voice was once so beautiful, Paulina Molitova.
He clicks his fingers, “remembers”. BERIA   
Oh yes. Meant to say. Stalin's dead!
We open up to reveal a woman - POLINA - in her late 50s, sat in a tiny, barren cell. She looks haggard, wrecked.

POLINA:
(shocked)
No! Our Stalin?

BERIA:
Yes, “your” Stalin. The one who put you here.
The waitress and an NKVD GUARD are also in the cell. Beria hauls Polina up. She doesn't resist.
BERIA   
Come! Let's smarten you up. (to waitress)
Sorry, darling. Work. I’ll make it

up to you. (to guard)
Fetch the mattress and have her washed.
He walks Polina out while Ilyin and another NKVD Man bring in flowers, a rug and a jug.
102 INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING 102
Beria leads Polina down a corridor.
An NKVD GUARD comes the other way, with Slimonov, handcuffed.

BERIA:
S...s...limonov, isn't it?

SLIMONOV:
Yes, sir.

BERIA:
F..f..f..farewell, Slimonov! Slimonov is led away.

CUT TO:
20 May 2016 Draft 10 62.
103 INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING 103
Khrushchev wheezes up three flights, pausing for breath before disappearing onto Molotov's landing.
104 INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - LANDING - EARLY EVENING 104
Khrushchev, exhausted and sweaty, reaches Molotov's door and knocks. He tries to compose himself but looks quite ill.
Molotov opens the door. He's been crying. Khrushchev barrels through, pulling Molotov with him.

MOLOTOV:
Christ, you look like you’re about to be bulldozed into a lime pit.
105 INT. MOLOTOV'S APARTMENT - TOILET - EARLY EVENING 105
A few moments later. Khrushchev is over the toilet bowl. Molotov is stood behind him.

MOLOTOV:
Do you want me to hold back your hair? Polina always used to do that for me.

KHRUSHCHEV:

I... wanted to invite you to tomorrow's committee meeting...

MOLOTOV:
(snaps back)
Why wouldn't I be at the meeting? Khrushchev flushes.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Beria and Stalin put you on a list.

MOLOTOV:
(shocked, hurt)
Stalin? I must have wronged him so badly...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Are you cracked? Beria wanted you out. But listen. We can honour his legacy by making sure Beria doesn’t...

MOLOTOV:
Oh! No, no, no. This sounds like factionalism, Nicky. Stalin didn’t like...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 63.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(loses it)
Stalin's dead. It's over. We have to act.

MOLOTOV:
(crying)
I can’t believe he’s gone...
Khrushchev tries to flush the toilet again. The cistern hasn't filled up yet. He tries a couple more times.
MOLOTOV   
It takes a while to...
Khrushchev gives up, keeps his voice down instead.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Come on. That fucking slug Beria

had your wife killed. He can’t be trusted...
106 INT. MOLOTOV'S APARTMENT - TOILET/CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING106
Molotov and Khrushchev walk back towards the living room.

MOLOTOV:
She betrayed Stalin and she betrayed me.
BERIA (O.S.)
Housekeeping!
107 INT. MOLOTOV'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING 107
Molotov and Khrushchev come through into the living room to find Beria. Everyone's surprised.
BERIA/KHRUSHCHEV/MOLOTOV
(at the same time)
What are you doing here?

KHRUSHCHEV:
We were just chatting about Polina.

BERIA:
Well, would you believe it?..

MOLOTOV:
The treacherous bitch.

BERIA:

...or:
framed.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 64.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Come on, Stalin found her guilty! She collaborated with the zionists.
Polina's at the doorway. Only Beria can see her. This is not going to plan.

MOLOTOV:
She was a criminal. I’m glad she’s dead...
Molotov notices her in the doorway. They look at each other. The barriers drop - it's clear he still loves her.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(hasn't seen her yet)
She plotted to poison Stalin...
He sees Molotov heading towards Polina. He can't believe it.

MOLOTOV:
Is it really you?

POLINA:
(full of love)
I'm back, Vyacheslav.
They hug, emotional. Beria enjoys it. Khrushchev tries to dig himself out of his hole.

KHRUSHCHEV:
But the evidence was flimsy. No witnesses, no corroboration... No...
Khrushchev gives up. Beria puts his arm round Molotov and Polina. It becomes a group hug.

BERIA:
(to Molotov)
I kept her safe. For you, Vyacheslav.
(to Polina)
And I kept HIM safe. For you, Polina.
Beria throws a victorious glance at Khrushchev. Molotov breaks down, overwhelmed.
Khrushchev tentatively joins the group hug.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Well done. Well done, everyone.

CUT TO:
20 May 2016 Draft 10 65.
108 INT. LUBYANKA - CELL - NIGHT 108

MUSIC:
OP.37
The young waitress from the dacha hunches on the bed of the spruced up cell. The door opens. Beria is there with flowers.

BERIA:
Hello, my sweet.
He moves to the table, where a bottle of wine has been uncorked. He sniffs it lasciviously, eyeing her legs. BERIA   
Mm. Everything at room temperature. Oh, lighten up. It could be worse. Be warned.
109 INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - KHRUSHCHEV'S FLAT - NIGHT 109
A miserable Khrushchev eats the stroganoff, occasionally looking out across the courtyard at the Molotovs, arm in arm. Nina has a mouthful. Grim. Khrushchev sees her disgust, silently picks up both plates, scrapes them into a bin.
110 EXT./INT. LUBYANKA ENTRANCE ONTO STREET - NIGHT 110
The waitress' frightened PARENTS wait. She appears - distraught, stoical. An NKVD GUARD hands the parents Beria’s bouquet. They hurry off.
111 ARCHIVE MATERIAL 2. 111
RUSSIA IN MOURNING. A red flag with black border flies above the walls of the Kremlin. Beyond it: Moscow, with more redand- black flags.

A Zis limousine arrives at the Kremlin.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 66.
114 INT. KREMLIN - ROW OF 3 INTERCONNECTING ROOMS - DAY 114
Beria walks jauntily through connecting doorways from the far end.
115 INT. KREMLIN - NEAR END OF INTERCONNECTING ROOMS - DAY 115
Malenkov being made up to look like a leader. He’s uncomfortable under studio lights as the PHOTOGRAPHER snaps away and STAFFERS bustle in and out with business. Two MAKEUP ARTISTS blotting and repairing his make-up.

PERVAK:
Comrade, I’ve scheduled telephone calls later with...

MALENKOV:
Then tell me LATER.

Beria arrives, looks at Malenkov and laughs.

BERIA:
Almost perfect. Perhaps... an apple just here, in the mouth?
Chuckling, Malenkov wipes his face with a towel.

MALENKOV:
I have something to tell you. (over shoulder)
I’ll be back shortly!
A smiling Malenkov grabs Beria and walks stiffly with him into the middle room. He drops the smile to show his fury. MALENKOV   
Don’t you ever, EVER, do that again. Humiliate me in front of...I’m the General Secretary!

BERIA:
(deferential)
I’m mortified. Genuinely.

MALENKOV:
Looking my best for the People is a duty.
Malenkov walks through the middle room and into the third room. His walks still seems a little stiff.

BERIA:
Of course. Shall we...

MALENKOV:
(spotting Pervak) What now?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 67.

PERVAK:
Apologies. The seating plan for...

MALENKOV:
Give it to Blavatsky. He’s an expert at sitting on his ass.

BERIA:

Shall we get onto..

MALENKOV:
Yes, the committee meeting. Item One. The lists. These arrests and “interrogations”. Do we just take them down a gear, or....

BERIA:
Hold off altogether?

MALENKOV:
What, “freeze” them?

BERIA:
“Freeze”? Excellent thought. Yes, we could freeze arrests, maybe even release some low-level prisoners?

MALENKOV:
Oh, fuck me. Really? Is this what the old man would have wanted?

BERIA:
Stalin was radical and popular.

MALENKOV:
Liberalisation WOULD be radical.
Now Delov has edged a little way into the room. MALENKOV   
I WILL ADDRESS WHATEVER HORSESHIT YOU HAVE, PRESENTLY!

BERIA:
No, this is something I wanted to show you.
Beria walks stiffly to the third room. Malenkov follows, as if he was going to do anyway.
Delov produces on a stand an iconic photograph of Stalin hugging a young girl on a balcony.
BERIA   
I thought, a photo of you and the girl. Continuity?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 68.

MALENKOV:
(delighted)
Good idea. We show how we’re taking Stalin’s humanity forward...

BERIA:
(to Delov)
Find this girl.
They leave the room.
116 INT. WEIRD-LOOKING KREMLIN ROOM OR CORRIDOR - DAY 116
Moments later. Malenkov and Beria walking to the meeting.

MALENKOV:
My chief concern is admitting we were wrong. All those arrests. And deaths...

BERIA:
We were being loyal. I promoted Stalin’s truth without question. I can promote a new truth without blinking.
An unblinking beat. BERIA   
So, I’ll push on with the releases?

MALENKOV:
Alright, but proceed carefully.

BERIA:
Of course.

MALENKOV:
Fuck this up and I’ll have you shot.
Beria says nothing. MALENKOV   
Just joking. I was testing you.

BERIA:
Is that a corset?
ANGLE on Malenkov’s body. A GIRDLE is apparent.

MALENKOV:
It's a girdle. Different thing altogether.

BERIA:
You wear it well.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 69.

MALENKOV:
But not worth raising with the Committee.
117 EXT. KREMLIN - STREET - DAY 117
Several more Zis limousines arrive at the Kremlin.
118 INT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM N°1 - DAY 118
The committee sit at a table in an impressive, high-ceilinged room. Malenkov is at the head of the table with his new hairdo and a smart new outfit. The room is dominated by a giant portrait of Stalin.

BERIA:
So, in accordance with... (re portrait)
...his will, I propose Comrade Malenkov be named Chairman of the Council of Ministers. And General Secretary of the Party.

MALENKOV:
(pompous nod)
And I propose Comrade Beria for First Vice-Chairman, Council of Ministers. Those in favour.
Beria, Malenkov and Mikoyan instantly put their hands up.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Wait. Those are two separate proposals. Comrade Beria is incredibly busy combining his roles as Minister for both the Interior and Security. It would perhaps be kinder for someone else to carry the happy burden of Vice-Chairman.

BERIA:

I thank Comrade Khrushchev for his concern but I can assure you that I'm capable of doing two things at once.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Well, it would actually be three things.

MALENKOV:
Let's move to a vote. (to Beria)
On both proposals?
Beria gesticulates as if to say 'Up to you'.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 70. MALENKOV   
Yes, on both. Me as General Secretary and Comrade Beria as Vice- Chairman. All those in favour?
Malenkov, Beria and Mikoyan raise their hands. Molotov joins them, then Bulganin and Kaganovich.
MALENKOV   
Carried...
Grudgingly, Khrushchev raises his hand. MALENKOV   
...unanimously. Next...

BERIA:
(interrupting)
We need someone to take charge of the funeral.

MOLOTOV:
What about Comrade Khrushchev?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(looking at Beria) Where’s this come from?

MALENKOV:
Yes, good thought.

BERIA:
I formally propose that Comrade

Khrushchev be given the honour of organising the funeral.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Beria)
But that will tie up all of my time, won’t it?

BERIA:
If I can do three jobs at once, you can at least do two.

KHRUSHCHEV:
But I need to be...

MOLOTOV:
(interrupting)
You wanted to honour his legacy. You told me last night, in the bathroom.
Molotov winks at Khrushchev: he's doing him a great favour. MALENKOV/BERIA
All those in favour..
20 May 2016 Draft 10 71.
Again, Molotov, Beria, Malenkov and Mikoyan raise their hands. Kaganovich decides to raise his hand.

KAGANOVICH:
(justifying himself) You'd be good at it. Bulganin raises his hand.

MALENKOV:
Carried... U... una...
Then, grudgingly again, Khrushchev. MALENKOV   
..carried unanimously.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Thank you. I shall remember this. Beria looks to Malenkov.

MALENKOV:
(trying to be formal)

Comrade Beria.
Beria clears his throat, looks extravagantly at ease.

BERIA:
I propose a halt to deportations. The release of some existing detainees. And the suspension of arrests officially sanctioned three days ago...
Molotov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich and Bulganin are shocked.

MIKOYAN:
You dare wipe your shitting arse on Stalin's lists!?

BULGANIN:
Let's all stay calm... although what you just said is utterly ridiculous.

BERIA:
(angry)
One of you look me in the eye and tell me you’re not heartsick at the relentless, pointless arrests.
Death after death after DEATH.
A charged beat as he looks around the room, defiant.

MALENKOV:
Gentlemen, I believe we must embrace a new reality.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 72. MALENKOV   
(”wanker” mime)
Yeah. “Embrace” it...

KAGANOVICH:
How are we going to explain all the people you very comprehensively arrested in the first place?

BERIA:
If there were errors, if people misguided us then we punish those

who did the misguiding...

MIKOYAN:
Arrest anyone who carried out a wrongful arrest? Lavrentiy, come on. We ALL signed off on that shit...

MALENKOV:
(thinks he can be commanding)
Stalin destroyed the status quo and built a new one. He was radical.

KHRUSHCHEV:
This is deliberately being rushed through. We don’t have time to..

BERIA:
I thought you were in favour of a more liberal approach, Comrade Reformer.
Khrushchev remains silent, roiling with conflicting emotions.

MALENKOV:
We must step back...

BERIA:
All those in favour...

MALENKOV:
(interrupting)
...of pausing the arrests and executions and so on?
Malenkov and Beria raise their arms. Mikoyan, reluctantly, joins them. Bulganin, Khrushchev and Kaganovich look at Molotov.

MOLOTOV:
I have always been loyal to Stalin. Always. And these arrests were authorised by Stalin.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 73.
The rest of the committee follow Molotov’s lengthy logic with

increasing frustration. MOLOTOV   
But Stalin was always loyal to the collective leadership. That is true loyalty. But he had an iron principle, undeviating, strong.
Shouldn’t we do the same, and stick to what we believed in? No. It’s stronger still to forge one’s own beliefs into the beliefs of collective leadership.
(a beat)
Which I have now done.
Molotov raises his hand. Kaganovich and Bulganin raise theirs. Finally, Khrushchev raises his hand.

MALENKOV:
Carried...

BERIA:
Good, I'll oversee...

MALENKOV:
(interrupting) Unanimously.

BERIA:
I'll oversee the releases. We have unloosened the Union’s great corset. Nikita, you've some swatches and bouquets to look at. A funeral doesn't organise itself.
We stay on Khrushchev as Molotov leans over. Malenkov prattles on in the background.

MOLOTOV:
(To Khrushchev)
You’ve won! Do him proud.

MALENKOV:
(in background)
Beria, I want you to put together a communique for the press. I'll supervise the

transfer of the body. Comrade Bulganin, tell the army; Comrade Mikoyan, the factories and the unions...

CUT TO:
119 EXT. GULAG - PRISON YARD - DAY 119
Twenty prisoners, including the Nervous Man, lined up to be shot by 5 GUARDS and CHASOV.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 74.

PRISONER:
Long live Stalin!

CHASOV:
Comrade Stalin's dead. Comrade Malenkov's in charge now.

PRISONER:
Long live Mal...
Chasov shoots him just as an NKVD officer, SHULGA runs up.

SHULGA:
Stop shooting!
Chasov turns, but fires off one more shot. It kills the Nervous Man, who slumps dead in the background.
SHULGA   
(indicating list)
Amnesties effective immediately. Orders of Comrade Beria. We’re pulling out.
They hurry off to join their colleagues. The NKVD’s mobilising, heading off. The prisoners are left, confused.

CUT TO:
120 INT. HOUSE OF THE TRADE UNIONS - HALL OF COLUMNS - DAY 120
Close-up of Stalin’s face in his coffin. Pull out and high to reveal enormous hall with people bustling, making last-minute preparations.
The UNDERTAKERS’ finishing touches: doing make-up, hair, moustache, polishing buttons. Huge flags hang from the ceiling. More are being rigged. Swathes of red, and flowers, everywhere.
Beria and Malenkov stroll along the other side of the hall.

BERIA:
Interrogations are on hold. First time we’ve had a chance to bleach the cells. Also, I’ve signed off a few amnesties. Petty thieves, harmless idiots...
MEZHNIKOV (mid 50s, fussy), the designer responsible for the funeral, stands beside a frustrated Khrushchev (in a red armband with black borders) at the head of Stalin's coffin.

MEZHNIKOV:
Now, curtains. Ruched or not ruched?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 75.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Ruched? What the fuck is ruched?
Mezhnikov demonstrates with the material under the coffin.

MEZHNIKOV:
Ruched. Not ruched. Ruched. Not ruched.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Why should I care? While you were hiding in your mama’s linen closet I was at Stalingrad! I ate rats.
Raw rats. Didn't even cook them!
Behind him, a nervous group of STEELWORKERS. Awkward, overawed. Khrushchev in his element with the Steelworkers. KHRUSHCHEV   
Ah, the Steelworkers. Some REAL men! Lads, come, come!
Malenkov moves over to assert his authority. Beria spots a line of girls and moves over to them.

MALENKOV:
Iron and steel are the very foundation of...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Steelworkers) Iron? IRON?

Derisory laughter. KHRUSHCHEV   
Capitalism was built on iron. STEEL
- is the 20th Century. The Soviet Union is made of steel! And these! Men! Made it!
Huge wave of suppressed applause, caught between joyous approval of Khrushchev and the solemnity of the place. Delov arrives with a group of sweet, very Russian-looking girls, aged 7-9.

MALENKOV:
You found my girl?

DELOV:
We can't find her, Comrade Minis... Comrade General Secretary. These are suggested alternatives.

MALENKOV:
(to Khrushchev) Find her!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 76.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I thought you bastards knew where EVERYONE was! Find her, camel-cock!
Pervak is stood awkwardly behind him with Maria Yudina, the pianist. Khrushchev turns and switches into chivalrous mode. KHRUSHCHEV   
Maria Veniaminovna. Please. Forgive my language, but he IS... one of those. This...
He gestures towards Malenkov who holds out his hand but she's seen Stalin in his coffin. It hits her.

MARIA:
Stalin!

KHRUSHCHEV:
Yes. Stalin.
Malenkov is left hanging. He joins in the solemn moment.

MALENKOV:

Sad times. Thank you for coming.

MARIA:
Oh, I can’t TELL you... the intensity of emotion when I heard.
General ZHUKHOV - 57, imposing, covered in medals - strides to the coffin, booming greetings to officers in the hall.
He's followed by some of his ENTOURAGE.

ZHUKHOV:
If it wasn’t for this man, I wouldn’t be here today. - He lent me his driver! Hah!
(to Pervak)
Pervak! Handsome as ever! Put you in a frock, I’d marry you myself!

BERIA:
(returning)
Ah, the generalissimo.

ZHUKHOV:
So, what does a war hero have to do to get some lubrication round here? (grabs one out of Delov's
hand)
Christ! Where’s this from, a Polish flamethrower? Tastes like PISS...
Slow-mo on Zhukhov as he drawls out 'Piss' with the caption:
20 May 2016 Draft 10 77.
"FIELD MARSHAL ZHUKHOV, HEAD OF THE SOVIET ARMY".

BACK TO NORMAL:

SPEED:
As the others talk, Mezhnikov shows Malenkov a choice of two portraits of him on boards to pick from.
Zhukhov reaches the others. ZHUKHOV   
Nikita! Sorry to hear about your wife’s affair!
(off his reaction)
She hasn’t had one yet but God, I like the look of her. Hah!

KHRUSHCHEV:
Yes, she is... pretty.

BERIA:
Zhukhov. So rare to see you away from a mirror.

ZHUKHOV:
Beria. Must be such a... (re coffin)
...difficult time for you, hiding your happiness at a promotion. (to Khrushchev)
Who stood down the army? Why have my men been sent back to their barracks? I’m smiling but I’m very fucking furious.

BERIA:
(notices Maria)
Perhaps Comrade Yudina should prepare those precious hands.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Maria, I am mortified I cannot escort you, but...
He kisses her hand.

BERIA:
How very friendly. You never kiss my hand anymore.

MARIA:
So lovely to see you again, Comrade Khrushchev.

BERIA:
Again?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 78.

MARIA:
I taught his wife’s niece to play.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Katya! Yes, we were both at the salon recital...

BERIA:
Oh, I LOVE the idea of you at a “salon”. You have a party trick? Burping the alphabet?
She sets off, passing Beria who whispers at her. BERIA   
So many...
(mimes piano-playing)
...notes. Like your one to Stalin. Which I have.
She looks back as she walks away, rattled.

ZHUKHOV:
So who confined the army to barracks?

KHRUSHCHEV:
That nonsense was NOT signed off by the whole committee.

ZHUKHOV:
Ah, so it was only one idiot, not the full set.
Malenkov has chosen the portrait he likes. He joins them.

MALENKOV:
What's going on?

ZHUKHOV:
Talk of the devil.

BERIA:
(to Zhukhov)
The decision was mine supported by Comrade Malenkov...

MALENKOV:
(not sure what they’re discussing)
We took a view. And made a

decision...

BERIA:
We’re discussing the city security.

MALENKOV:
I know.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 79.

ZHUKHOV:
(about Malenkov’s hair)
Christ, did Coco Chanel shit on your head?
(to Beria)
Moscow will be boiling with people. Your pansy torturers won't cope, you know. That’s a job for MEN.

BERIA:
Oh, I have PLENTY. NKVD AND the...

MALENKOV:
Interior troops. Merged now, into this “KGB”...

ZHUKHOV:
(kissy lips)
“KGB”. Even SOUNDS like a bunch of nancies.

BERIA:
We’re controlling the crowd at source. All trains inbound to Moscow have been cancelled...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(interrupts)
But... I'm the trains! I'm the fucking funeral, I... I should have been asked.

GIRL:
(to Khrushchev)
Please, Sir. I need to go...

MALENKOV:
I think she needs the toilet.

ZHUKHOV:
(to Malenkov)
You need the army here. Not Beria’s Keystone Cops.

BERIA:
Maybe we should see who can mobilise first. Oh. It seems to be me...
He heads off before Zhukhov can answer.

MALENKOV:
(to Zhukhov)
We've got this under control. (to Khrushchev)

You:
(to little girl)
20 May 2016 Draft 10 80. (MORE)

And you:
and she'll take you to the toilet.
He sets off after Beria. Delov heads off with the girls.

ZHUKHOV:
I need to punch someone.

KHRUSHCHEV:
May I suggest...
Khrushchev nods at a stack of boards with a portrait of a very airbrushed Malenkov being carried past.

ZHUKHOV:
He looks like my auntie after two peach brandies.

MEZHNIKOV:
(calls from by the doors) We're opening the doors!

A line of MEN IN COLOURFUL AIR FORCE/NAVY UNIFORMS take
position at intervals from the door to the coffin and beyond. We hear a large CROWD coming up the stairs. They pour in through the doors, a tidal wave of grieving humanity.

20 May 2016 Draft 10 81. MALENKOV (CONT'D)

FEDIN:
No trains to Moscow! No... go... go back to your homes...
The crowd of people turn around and trudge purposefully along the railway track. Among them is the family we saw in sc123.

Svetlana chatting to Bulganin and Mikoyan, who clearly have to be somewhere else but feel obliged to talk to her.

SVETLANA:
...Papa always spoke with great

fondness of you two. “My hammer and sickle” he always used to say, although I was never sure which...

BULGANIN:
Never heard that before. How...gratifying.

MIKOYAN:
I’d be the sickle. Sharp. Poor Comrade Bulganin here...well, see he even has a head like the blunt end of a ball hammer...

SVETLANA:
(off polite laughter)
My father always used to say go to you two when I need advice.

BULGANIN:
Oh.

SVETLANA:
..or help...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 82.

MIKOYAN:
Ah.

SVETLANA:
(a hand on each)
“They are true and loyal men.”

MIKOYAN:
Any time. Any time at all. Sorry, we have to take our places.
Svetlana alone. She leans over a balustrade, watching the grieving crowd. Beria joins her.

SVETLANA:
This is... real. Nobody’s making them do this.
In the crowd below: grandmothers sob; a sailor removes his hat out of respect but drops it. The crowd keep moving and he

scrabbles his way back to try and get his hat.

BERIA:
I don't suppose you want a chair?
Beria signals to an NKVD man who approaches with a chair.

SVETLANA:
I haven't sat down since he died. He was too big. You have to stand.

BERIA:
(what?) Yes.
Beria signals “no”. The NKVD man leaves with the chair.

SVETLANA:
Do you remember Yuri?

BERIA:
(no)
I remember everyone. It’s a gift.

SVETLANA:
I loved him.

BERIA:
(suddenly remembers)
Yuri Zhednov! Yes, special to you, I know. Some unsuitable associates. Tragic, really. I’m so sorry.

SVETLANA:
I want you to bring him back.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 83.

BERIA:
(are you mad?)
But, my chick, how?

SVETLANA:
You brought Molotov’s wife back.

BERIA:
She was... I'd kept her.....

SVETLANA:
You’re returning so many people to their homes. I want ONE person. Is that really too much?
A beat.

BERIA:
For you, I will attempt the impossible.
He opens his arms to her. She awkwardly steps into them.

SVETLANA:
Thank you.

BERIA:
I hate seeing you sad.

SVETLANA:
(awkward)
I hate that you hate seeing me sad. They hug awkwardly.
129 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - DAY 129
The crowd files past the coffin: ordinary citizens mingle with representatives from nations and regions carrying demarcated floral tributes. Andreyev and Sergei supervise the music from a balcony.
130 ARCHIVE MATERIAL 5. 130
FOOTAGE OF DELEGATIONS, FLORAL TRIBUTES, CEREMONIES ALL OVER SOVIET UNION, QUEUES, PEOPLE COMING UP STAIRS.
131 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - DAY 131
OUR FOOTAGE of the committee: Molotov, Kaganovich, Bulganin, Khrushchev, Malenkov, Beria and, closest to the public, Mikoyan, who's crying. A large wreath nearly brushes his face. He sneezes. A film crew is recording.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 84.

MIKOYAN:
(sotto)
Fucking pollen. They should make gas bombs with this stuff.
Molotov, sobbing heavily, looks across, sees him.

MOLOTOV:

I know. I know...
The wreaths and bouquets are getting absurdly big. One - with the message "From the grieving people of Uzbekistan" on it - only just fits through the large double doorway.

BERIA:
(to Malenkov)
I think that's actually larger than the region itself.
Malenkov’s little involuntary laugh. Molotov sees, disapproves.

MALENKOV:
(chiding Beria) Inappropriate.
The Uzbek bouquet makes its way past. On the staircase, some mitres bobbing up and down, some very worn. A group of ORTHODOX BISHOPS approaching in full regalia.
Shocked whispers from committee members. Not Beria. MALENKOV   
No!

KAGANOVICH:
Jesus Christ! It's the bishops!

KHRUSHCHEV:
What are these bastards doing at MY FUCKING FUNERAL?

BULGANIN:
Did I dream the last 36 years? Are we doing the revolution again from the START?

MIKOYAN:
The Church belongs where we left it. In a ditch.

MOLOTOV:
Tell Mikoyan to sneeze on the bastards as they go past.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Malenkov)

Did you invite them?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 85.

MALENKOV:
No!

KHRUSHCHEV:
Ask Beria if it was him.

MALENKOV:
Don’t order me around. (to Bulganin)
Ask Beria if he invited the fucking bishops.

BULGANIN:
(to Beria)
Did you invite the fucking bishops?

BERIA:
Yes.
Bulganin turns back, chewing over Beria’s answer.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Well?
Bulganin nods to Malenkov.

MALENKOV:
Yes. He did.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I'm going to give everyone in Red Square a voucher permitting one kick each to his stupid face.

BERIA:
(to Bulganin)
Is he asking for more delicious hay?

BULGANIN:
No. He said something quite complicated about a voucher system.

KHRUSHCHEV:
This is rehabili... Listen to me! This is rehabilitation of the most counter revolutionary elements! He can't do that without the committee.

MALENKOV:
(taking over from Bulganin)
He says you can't do it without the committee. Which is true...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 86.

BERIA:
(interrupting)
I can cancel house arrests under article 31.
Malenkov realises he is right.

MALENKOV:
(to Khrushchev)
He can in fact cancel house arrests under article 31.
The camera crew is on them again. They all look as solemn as they can. The bishops pass the coffin, making the sign of the cross.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Malenkov)
Tell him that I... Actually, swap... swap...

MALENKOV:
No!

KHRUSHCHEV:
Swap!

MALENKOV:
No!

KHRUSHCHEV:
We can make it look like it's part

of the ceremony.
A dignified Khrushchev steps forward. Malenkov motionless, staring at NAVY OFFICERS struggling to get a too-high wreath through the door.
The officers back up, then advance solemnly in a squatting position. The wreath low enough to go through but still too wide. Khrushchev eases back into line.

BERIA:
(whispers to Khrushchev)
If only someone had checked...
The navy officers back up again with the wreath, then walk in with it sideways and squatting.
Suddenly, an angry voice, away from the crowd. Vasily, in full uniform, drunk, trying to get to the coffin. Arguing with SENIOR NKVD OFFICERS, one of whom has a loudhailer.

VASILY:
They're murderers! Murderers! Give me your loudhailer!...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 87.
From their balcony, Andreyev and Sergei see Vasily. Sergei turns up a dial and the music grows louder.

BERIA:
(whispers to Khrushchev)
Did you forget to give him his sedatives?

VASILY:
...If you don't hand it over I'll shove it so far up your arse your farts will deafen Moscow!
(to Committee)
...I KNOW YOU KILLED MY FATHER!

KHRUSHCHEV:
(whispers to Bulganin)
Tell them to get the steel workers. (to Malenkov)
We have to go!...
The whisper goes from Bulganin to Kaganovich to Molotov to Tarasov, who hurries off.
Vasily, now restrained, getting louder.

VASILY:
I WILL AVENGE MY FATHER, YOU BUTTONED-UP SACKS OF SHIT!
Some of the crowd are starting to notice. Sergei raises the volume a bit more.

ANDREYEV:
Don't record this!
132 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - WAITING ROOM - DAY 132
A group of STEEL WORKERS chat and smoke, putting on new overalls and caps bearing the hammer and sickle. Some have medals.
Tarasov runs in.

TARASOV:
Quick! We need you now! NOW!
The steel workers are confused - they're not ready. TARASOV   
Are you actually made of steel? Now! Move!
The NKVD bundle them outside as, frenzied, they put out cigarettes, haul on jackets and, in one case, trousers.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 88.
133 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - DAY 133
The steel workers emerge in a rush, trying to look dignified. Some are still hopping along, getting dressed.
Vasily struggling with officers. One has his hand over Vasily's mouth. A bite - ouch - he lets go.
Beria, over his shoulder, sees the steel workers approach.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Move, you hairy-assed sluggards!
They all turn to go. The manoeuvre turns into hesitant chaos. Molotov’s in front.

VASILY:
Liars and revisionists! You killed Stalin!
Molotov sets off and the others follow him. He's not setting a fast enough pace - those at the back bunch up.

MOLOTOV:
Decorum, please..

BERIA:
Faster, you SNAIL.

MOLOTOV:
(to Vasily, trying to be both quiet and loud) SHHHHHH! SHHHHHUSHH!
Pursued by the NKVD, Vasily rushes up some stairs.
Beria breaks from the line, speed-walks until he's pretty much out of public view then breaks into a run and heads up the staircase. Khrushchev follows.
134 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - SMALL DIGNITARIES ROOM - DAY 134
A quiet holding area. Some Communist LEADERS including ZHOU ENLAI, with their TRANSLATORS.
Vasily rushes in.

VASILY:
Friends! There has been a terrible crime!
Zhou EnLai's translator translates for the Chinese leader. VASILY   
My father - they killed him. They got a child to cut out his brain and send it to Washington!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 89.
Zhou Enlai's TRANSLATOR stops, then carries on. VASILY   
They’re ruthless monsters and sodomites!
The translator is trying to get every nuance. An NKVD officer grabs Vasily and pull him away. VASILY   
...sucking the cocks and balls of New York Zionist queers in petticoats...
The translator makes sure he does the insult justice.
135 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - LANDING OR ADJOINING ROOM - DAY 135
The NKVD wrestle Vasily to the ground. Beria and Khrushchev arrive.

VASILY:
I’ll make sure you all stand trial and get garotted by your own

lookalikes in Red Square...

BERIA:
Vasily. It's me.
Beria kneels beside Vasily who tries to spit at him, but he's lying down, so the spit just drops back onto his face.

VASILY:
Syphilitic cannibals! Zoo animals..

BERIA:
I know about the dead hockey team. The pretence. The denial.
Vasily stops struggling. He's accepted defeat.

VASILY:
Freak weather. (calmly)
I want to make a speech at the funeral.

BERIA:
(To Khrushchev)
He wants to make a speech at the funeral.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Oh, MORE good news.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 90.
The Dignitaries from inside the room quietly file out, and past Vasily and Co.
VASILY.
I'm his son. (flaring up again, struggling)
Let me speak, you howling chimps...
Zhukhov appears, pushes Vasily into the now-vacated dignitaries room and punches Vasily hard across the face, knocking out a tooth. Vasily falls to the floor, unconscious. Zhukhov pockets the tooth.

ZHUKHOV:
I'll stick it under my pillow tonight. May even make a ruble.

He smiles at Beria - that's how you sort things round here. Beria notices that Svetlana's watching a few yards away, distressed.

BERIA:
Lana! He's my godson. I won't let anything happen to him.
She turns and hurries off.

SVETLANA:
Something has already happened to him!

BERIA:
Lana!
(to an NKVD man)
Tell her I'll be with her in a moment.
The NKVD man sets off after Svetlana.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(grabs Beria, and makes sure no-one else is around in the room)
Not yet! (close, angry)
You’re bringing the Church back? What next? Are the Romanovs coming?

BERIA:
Don’t be hysterical. We are in a new reality.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 91. KHRUSHCHEV   
Well don’t you sound fancy? You locked half the nation up. Beat them. Raped them. Killed them.

BERIA:
Yes, and now I'm releasing them. I put so many in jail, there are so many to let go. You won’t believe how many will be free. Millions!
The revolutions continues...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Not true. You're just doing it to gain power. You bend and crack the truth, like it was a human body.

BERIA:
Oh, you want the “truth”? Let’s start with you calling the blameless Polina Molotova a Zionist spy. In her own apartment. I heard you. And so did my men.
He taps his ear to indicate they were listening.

KHRUSHCHEV:
But she was found guilty. You FOUND her guilty.

BERIA:
Past tense. In those “old days” you pine for, Nicky, that dissonance would get you shot.
Khrushchev starts to speak, Beria cuts him off. BERIA   

More truth:
doctor Timashuk to Stalin's bedside...

KHRUSHCHEV:
That was your idea!

BERIA:
You initiated it. Again, there are recordings. A woman who denounced thousands of innocent doctors.
Khrushchev is thrown.

KHRUSHCHEV:
We ALL signed off on those arrests.

BERIA:
You're old regime, Khrushchev. Counter-revolutionary.

20 May 2016 Draft 10 92. (MORE)
The man who fucked up the flowers and invited his bit-on-the-side whore to play at the funeral. Even though she swore to kill Stalin.
Who’s now dead.

KHRUSHCHEV:
What are you talking about? Beria hands him Maria's note.

BERIA:
She wanted Stalin dead and she knows your family. It's lucky we now live in the new Soviet Union or you and your wife and children would now be a pile of dust on the floor of a crematorium toilet.
Khrushchev reads the note. The colour drains from his face.
136 INT. HALL OF COLUMNS - STAIRS - DAY. 136
Khrushchev comes back down the stairs and into the Hall of Columns.
He sees some bishops in the distance, calls to an NKVD guard.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Get those boyfriends of Christ out of my sight!
We see the Bishops being moved away. There is some applause coming from a section of the queue.
KHRUSHCHEV   
I see they agree with me.

NKVD GUARD:
No, Comrade Khrushchev, it’s because they’ve spotted him.
He gestures over to the applauding section of the crowd. We can just make out Beria walking past, enjoying the applause.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Start the trains. The people can come to Moscow!
Meanwhile Beria is enjoying his moment. He’s with Kubulov.

BERIA:
The revolution continues! (to Kubulov)
Now start the other one.

CUT TO:
20 May 2016 Draft 10 93. BERIA (CONT'D)
137 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - DAY. 137
A black maria pulls up. Several confused PRISONERS, some beaten, some of whom we saw arrested earlier, get out. The van drives off.

CUT TO:
138 EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT 138
The provincial train TRACKS we saw earlier. Crowds are camped in front of the NKVD and Fedin with pictures of Stalin, candles, flowers etc.
A whistle blows.

TRAIN GUARD:
For Moscow! Train to Moscow! People rush forward.

CUT TO:
139 INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 139
The distinctive design we saw earlier. The woman turns away from the window. She's heard something. The middle-aged man who was arrested has returned. He's been beaten.
She rushes over and hugs him. His son sits awkwardly in a

chair:

CUT TO:
140 INT./EXT. TRAIN ON PLATFORM - DAY 140
CROWDS clamber onto the train, including the FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN we saw earlier. Excitement, people clambering on board. Train packed full.
141 INT. LUBYANKA - PRISON CELL - DAY 141
A PRISONER and the NKVD Interrogator from sc 73. The cell door opens and a SOLDIER points a gun. The Interrogator moves to allow a clearer shot at the Prisoner. But the Soldier shoots the Interrogator. The Prisoner’s relieved moan. The Soldier shoots him too, and leaves. We hear O.S a succession

of unlocking doors, yells and double-gunshots
20 May 2016 Draft 10 94.
142 INT. KREMLIN - LARGE STAIRCASE - LATE AFTERNOON 142
KHRUSHCHEV alone, slowly making his way up the stairs. He can hear piano music. Someone practicing. He is trying to find the source.

CUT TO:
143 INT. KREMLIN - SMALL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 143
A small room full of images of Stalin, and some of Malenkov.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(holding out note) This your work, is it?
Cut to Maria sitting as if in an interrogation, but with piano nearby.

MARIA:
Why? Are there spelling mistakes?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(suddenly furious)
Don’t ever speak to me like that again or I’ll break your fingers! (waving note)
The ammunition you've given Beria. Linking us. Me, my family. Do you know what sort of man he is?

MARIA:
He’s releasing people from prison...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Releasing people was my idea! He rapes children! Did you know that? He's murdered millions.

MARIA:
Have you?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Have I what?

MARIA:
Raped children, murdered millions?

KHRUSHCHEV:
I do not rape children! (pauses, agitated)
I am not Beria! I have... stood up against our enemies. I have been relentless in my defence of the nation and the party. And I have hated doing what I had to do.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 95. (MORE)
Hated it. But Beria loves every minute. I'm the reformer, not him! (trying to calm down)
Why did you write that note?

MARIA:
Stalin killed my parents, my friends, Zinaida Reich, Kuperchinski.

KHRUSHCHEV:
You were friends with Kuperchinski? Christ! Anyone else?!
He's furious. Maria tries to hide her fear.

MARIA:
I don't know. Rovik perhaps? We were friends.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Rovik?! How the fuck are you even still alive?

MARIA:
Comrade. Nikita Sergeyevich, you know me, I...

KHRUSHCHEV:
No I don’t know you. Don’t say I know you. But now Beria ties me to you, and you know how this works.

They kill your parents, then your sister. And brother. And friends....

MARIA:
Yes. I know how you all work.
For a beat it feels like Khrushchev might slap her.
144 INT. BERIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT/EARLY EVENING 144
Sparsely furnished. Vasily in vest and military trousers, practising his speech. Svetlana sits on the bed.

VASILY:
My father was a warm and mighty bear...

SVETLANA:
He was. He WAS...

VASILY:
That bear now lies cold. We, 170 million cubs, his weeping orphans.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 96. KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D) (MORE)
Russian cubs, Georgian cubs, Armenian cubs. Lithuanian cubs...

SVETLANA:
Do you list every nation?

VASILY:
Should I not?
There's a knock on the door. Beria comes in.

BERIA:
How’s my precious guest?
Vasily looks at him flatly, clearly still mistrustful.

SVETLANA:
Thank you for looking after him.

BERIA:
Of course.
(offers him a hip flask)

I brought you something to calm your nerves.
Vasily hesitates. Beria takes a swig. BERIA   
Vasily, I'm your godfather. I would never poison you. I'd arrange a plane crash or something.
(he laughs, they don't)

VASILY:
Your jokes are always so.. clenched.
Svetlana takes the flask from Vasily, gives it back to Beria. Vasily’s about to protest but Svetlana’s firm.

SVETLANA:
(to Vasily, at Beria)
We agreed we would be presentable at the reception.
Vasily sulkily agrees.

VASILY:
I hate being sober. It’s a terrible, terrible mood to be in.
She kisses him and leaves with Beria, who’s impressed.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 97. VASILY (CONT'D)
145 INT. BERIA'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT/EARLY EVENING 145 (CONTINUOUS)
Beria and Svetlana come out of the room and shut the door. They walk away, leaving an NKVD MAN on guard.

BERIA:
(indicates speech)
Going to “reaffirm” your father’s contract with the people. New rights. New liberties...

SVETLANA:
Why does everything have to be “new”?
They go through into...
146 INT. BERIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/EARLY EVENING 146 (CONTINUOUS)

A comfortable living room – the nicest we've seen. Fireplace, rug, souvenirs and gifts all over. On a table, a massive file is open.

SVETLANA:
...”new” potatoes...”new” Spring
Fashions...”new”...
Beria hands Svetlana a long, long list from the file, indicates an entry.

BERIA:
Yuri's dead. March 15th, 1949. Attempted escape from Kolyma with twelve others. Executed. I’m Sorry...
Svetlana bursts into tears, crumples.

SVETLANA:
But... you said you'd bring him back. You...

BERIA:
It wasn't possible...

SVETLANA:
You lied to me!...

BERIA:
It was outside my jurisdiction. He indicates the list.
Vasily suddenly enters the room, looking for the flask.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 98.

VASILY:
My mind’s going everywhere, like a million clarinets! I need...
He’s spotted the flask. Svetlana, furious, grabs it as Beria silently signals to the NKVD Man to escort Vasily back into the room and lock the door. Vasily miserably complies.

SVETLANA:
(ignoring Vasily, and reading the letter)
Signed by the entire Committee.

BERIA:
(tenderly)
Sit down, Svetlana.

SVETLANA:
I’d prefer to...

BERIA:
(kind, forceful) Sit down.
Svetlana refuses. She’s angry, scared, defiant, pacing. BERIA   
We had to do some terrible things for the Union. Your father said: Always look in the distance, never at the mud and blood at your feet. But, Svetlana, if Yuri were alive today I’d be releasing him.

SVETLANA:
So you’re saying, all that... (indicates list)
...killing was wrong.

BERIA:
(impatient)
Many lies were told. Evidence was fabricated. Those responsible will be found and...

SVETLANA:
Shot? This killing machine is never going to stop, is it?

BERIA:
Grow up, Svetlana! The world out there is full of dangerous men in uniforms and dinner suits. I’m offering you and that...gabbling bowl of moonshine my protection.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 99.

SVETLANA:

We are not children! (rethinks)
I am not a child!

BERIA:
Oh you are. And I warn you, Svetlana. Stay by my side. Or you’ll both be beaten inside out and strung up for the crows. By the others.

SVETLANA:
Why should I trust you?

BERIA:
Because I’m the only one who’s telling you - trust no-one else.

SVETLANA:
Can I keep this?

BERIA:
Of course. Svetlana, I am so very sorry.

SVETLANA:
You’re just like my father.
She kisses him tenderly on the cheek and leaves.
He goes to a hidden DOOR and unlocks it. Goes up some dark and dusty stairs, to a small room. We see a mattress, a vase with flowers, and an awkward teenage girl, crying.
He smiles at her.

BERIA:
Oh no. I’m here to cheer you up...
147 INT. KREMLIN RECEPTION - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 147
A wall of noise. And bodies. It's the end of a dinner. The dignitaries have broken into groups to smoke, drink and chat. Maria’s playing Chopin. We’re with Khrushchev as he weaves his way round.
Zhukhov is regaling DIGNITARIES with a war story.

ZHUKHOV:
The greatest enemy any soldier has

to face? It’s not guns, or fear, or hunger. It's chafing...
Svetlana is with Vasily who's smartened up and sobered up. She scans the room.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 100.

VASILY:
I’ve made enemies of everyone here. Oh Christ, sober’s HARD.

SVETLANA:
(encouraging)
You're doing well. I almost believe that smile.

VASILY:
It’s easy. All I have to do is say hello, shake their hands, and not call them cunts.
The HUNGARIAN PRESIDENT comes up to them, shakes hands. Vasily’s about to say something...
We’re now with Beria as he enters the room, creating a gravitational pull.
Back with Vasily and Svetlana. HUNGARIAN PRESIDENT
All of Hungary sends you our deepest condolences. Anything you want from us, just ask.

SVETLANA:
Vasily, anything you want from Hungary?

VASILY:
A horse, I would like. Big horse.
Khrushchev comes into the room and looks around. DELOV comes up to him with a spotty, awkward TEENAGE GIRL.

DELOV:
Comrade Minister. I've found her. Khrushchev looks at her, full of contempt.

KHRUSHCHEV:
She’s too big! She looks like a

baby giraffe fell down some stairs.
Delov takes her away. Kaganovich and Bulganin join Khrushchev.

KAGANOVICH:
Heard you were “canoodling” with the pianist?

BULGANIN:
Yeah, she give it plenty of left hand, Nicky?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 101.

KAGANOVICH:
Did she sit on your Presidium?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(ignoring them)
This is classic Beria. Nail the woman as a spy, link her to the man, nail the man. I need someone with an army. Now!
Svetlana spots Mikoyan. He tries to avoid her gaze, but she’s insistent.

SVETLANA:
Comrade Sickle! You look very dashing tonight!

MIKOYAN:
(disdaining Vasily)
Thank you. I hope your brother isn’t armed this evening...

SVETLANA:
He’s not even loaded!

VASILY:
Fuck me!
Mikoyan pretends he’s being called away. He’s off. VASILY   
“He’s not even loaded”?

KHRUSHCHEV:

(joining Zhukhov)
Comrade Field Marshall. A word?

ZHUKHOV:
I’m in the middle of a...
Khrushchev steering Zhukhov to a door.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Zhukhov’s companions)
He either planted the flag on Hitler’s bunker, or knocked the bear out with one punch.
(to Zhukhov)
There’s an urgent military matter. He guides him away.

ZHUKHOV:
Bloody rude, actually, Nicky. It wasn't Hitler's bunker, it was Goebbels’. And it genuinely happened.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 102.
They pass Bulganin, who’s a little agitated.

BULGANIN:
What’s going on, Nicky? They say the streets are heaving with people...
Zhukhov and Khrushchev exchange a glance. Back with Svetlana and Vasily.
Molotov approaches, his arms reaching out.

VASILY:
Here’s Molotov. A hundred rubles says he calls us ‘comrades’ then hugs us.

MOLOTOV:
(to Svetlana and Vasily) Comrades!

VASILY:
(sotto)
I’m not kissing him.

Khrushchev steering Zhukhov to out the doorway of the main reception and across the large stairway.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(conspiratorial)
Could I count on you if someone we both know was out of control, dangerous...

ZHUKHOV:
(sotto)
Yes! Wanted to deal with him for bloody ages. I'm in.
Khrushchev shows them into...
148 INT. KREMLIN - EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 148
Khrushchev and Zhukhov are alone.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(that was easy)
Really? Good. Because he's planning a coup.

ZHUKHOV:
What? Come on, Nicky. He’s so pissed all the time he can’t tell his arse from his windpipe.
Khrushchev pauses.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 103.

KHRUSHCHEV:
We ARE talking about the same person. Yes?
ZHUKHOV *
Vasily? *
KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D) Beria. ZHUKHOV
Beria? Well, someone's grown balls the size of Kremlin domes. Yes, bravo. Bloody Beria. How DARE that hookworm try to out-manouevre the army!

KHRUSHCHEV:
He wants to hijack my reforms, make the people love him...

ZHUKHOV:
The people are a pendulum of idiots. They can be made to hate him...
(clicks fingers)
Like that. But listen, Nicky... (closer)
I’ve got the soldiers. What have you got..?

KHRUSHCHEV:
All I’ve got is the funeral, and flowers and fucking trains.
A beat.
Khrushchev picks up a phone. KHRUSHCHEV   
(down the phone)
Get me the Transport Minister...
Zhukhov slamming doors, opening cupboards.

ZHUKHOV:
You’d think there’d be vodka. Even beancounters drink vodka...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(shushing him)
Double the train services into Moscow.
He hangs up.
They head back the stairway to the reception.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 104.

ZHUKHOV:
Moscow’s full already. It’ll be total bloody chaos. Well played, Comrade.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I'm the peacemaker round here and I'll fuck up anyone who gets in my way!

ZHUKHOV:

Cock the size of an atomic bomb.
149 INT. KREMLIN RECEPTION - MAIN ROOM (CONTINUOUS) 149
Maria at the piano, playing. Beria leans in and whispers, cleaning his glasses.

BERIA:
So what does Nikita taste like? I assume it's shitty traitor, like you. What do YOU taste of, I wonder?
She stops playing. Dramatic silence.

MARIA:
I will carry on if you step away from the piano.

BERIA:
(innocent, to the room)
I always thought that piece ended in an odd place!
Beria steps back from Maria and she carries on playing. Malenkov is with Delov and a LITTLE GIRL who looks very like the one from the picture.

MALENKOV:
Smile, sweetheart.
The girl reveals terrible teeth. MALENKOV   
With your mouth shut? (off her closed mouth) Lovely.

MOLOTOV:
Now I must take my dog out. For an evacuation! Perhaps two!
Molotov leaves.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 105.

SVETLANA:
(you’re the biggest)
When this is over, go home and drink vodka until you pass out. I never want to see you sober again.
150 EXT. NARROW MOSCOW STREETS - NIGHT 150

We cut from street to street, and see them fill with people. Wider shots reveal them coming in all directions. Hordes of people on narrow streets, getting very crowded.
An NKVD colonel, ENTIN is having a quiet cigarette. He looks up. At the end of the street, the crowd are heading towards him.
He's on a barricade made of trucks and armoured cars with gun turrets, manned by about 20 NKVD SOLDIERS.
Entin motions for the loudhailer.
It's passed to him. He addresses the crowd.

ENTIN:
Halt! This is a secure area! Return to your homes, comrades! Now!
The crowd hesitate but don't stop. Some hold images of Stalin.

WOMAN:
(shouts)
We've come to see Comrade Stalin. Others in the crowd roar approval.

ENTIN:
Please, stop! Or we will have to open fire!
They're still coming. The streets are jammed, heaving. People straining, crying, children being passed over heads.
ENTIN   
(to his soldiers)
On my order, fire over their heads.
The soldiers take aim. One of them shoots in panic. Panic in the crowds.
ENTIN   
I have not given the command!
Shrieking. Bodies being lifted. Some pick up rocks and stones from the street.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 106. ENTIN   
Disperse! Go back!...
The crowd begin to advance. Entin draws his revolver. People start throwing rocks. One hits Entin. He staggers back, bleeding. The crowd is almost upon them.
ENTIN    FIRE!

The soldiers and machine guns fire. The soldiers reload and keep firing, panicking.
The screams of the crowd mix with the terrifying gunshots. ENTIN   
CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE!
It stops. Entin stares out, horrified. His POV: piles of bodies, mostly dead, some wounded: men, women, children.

CUT TO:
151 INT. KREMLIN RECEPTION/STAIRCASE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 151

NOTE:
SPREAD, THE ROOM GRADUALLY EMPTIES AS OFFICIALS ARE SEEN BEING INSTRUCTED TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.
Beria approaches Malenkov, followed closely by Khrushchev. Malenkov is practicing for the photo, holding the girl up.

MALENKOV:
What's going on?

BERIA:
(through smile)
That moron put the trains back on. Rioting crowds. Fifteen hundred dead.

MALENKOV:
(putting the girl down) No, you're too heavy.
She’s put down and taken away.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Beria’s men fired on the crowds. He’s out of control, Georgy, I...

BERIA:
(to Khrushchev)
What’s between your ears? Sausage?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 107.

MALENKOV:
Oh, I think I know who the people will blame.
(indicates self)

The poor old shitsack in charge...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Georgy, look...

MALENKOV:
Delov, bring the girl back. I need to make an appearance.

BULGANIN:
Perhaps the army should be in charge of the railway stations.
Delov brings the girl back as Zhukhov arrives.

ZHUKHOV:
Bit late now, eh Beria?

BERIA:
They were outside Moscow, on his orders!

MALENKOV:
My orders? They were... (points with girl’s hand)
...your orders!
And starting the trains... (pointing at Khrushchev)
...were his orders!

KAGANOVICH:
So, what are YOU going to do?

MIKOYAN:
(to girl)
What do you think, darling? You’re the only one making any sense.
They all gradually edge out the room to a quieter spot by the staircase.

MALENKOV:
Someone is going to have to be the face of this fucking travesty.

BERIA:

That's easy:

KHRUSHCHEV:
No!

BERIA:
You ordered the trains!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 108.

KHRUSHCHEV:
And your men shot the people getting off them.

MALENKOV:
He does have a point.

BERIA:
No he doesn’t. There is no point to Nikita Khrushchev.
Malenkov signals - The girl is taken away again.

MALENKOV:
We should blame the security forces. Hothead officers on the ground...

BERIA:
(to Malenkov)
God Almighty, can you THINK? Or can you only pose for portraits? I. Am. Security. You...
(mimicking Malenkov’s openmouthed surprise)
...baked cod in a haircut.

MIKOYAN:
Oh, says the fucking jellied eel...

BULGANIN:
Let’s all calm down. (to Malenkov)
Even if you DO get blamed. We close ranks. We rehabilitate you, we...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Yes, it's the new Soviet Union now...

MALENKOV:
For the good of the party I ask...

BERIA:
You spineless rat! Fuck you! You’re just a bloated corpse we propped up and stuck in a fancy uniform.
(to the room)
You want to blame me? It's time all of you realised who kept the daggers out of your fucking backs! Show some fucking respect! I have documents on all of you. ALL OF YOU!
(to Khrushchev)
13th March, 1937. Zolotov trials.
42 dead, 173 exiled. Your signature. 5th October 1946.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 109. (MORE)
Katzenelson. 63 executed, 219 exiled. Your signature...

KAGANOVICH:
Beria. Enough.

BERIA:
(to Kaganovich)
Radek, Skrypny, your own brother. Your signature...
He gestures at Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Bulganin and Mikoyan. Malenkov is stood behind him.
BERIA   
All of you! I've seen what you've done. It’s a very! Fucking! Long! List!
He scatters some papers on the floor. Silence. The committee stare at the papers.

BULGANIN:
(heading off)
I think I saw some brandy out here...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Lavrentiy. We can put this right.

BERIA:
(calming down)
We'll meet straight after the funeral tomorrow. We will find out who's properly to blame for this. Arraign the officers who fired.
Yes?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Of course.
Beria heads down the stairs.
The others stand there, still stunned from Beria's outburst. KHRUSHCHEV   
We can just demote him. Make him Minister Responsible for Fisheries or something.

MALENKOV:
Do you know what you’re saying?

KHRUSHCHEV:
He's using you, Georgy. He'll use you and then he'll kill you. You saw those papers.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 110. BERIA (CONT'D)

MALENKOV:
He pointed at you, not me.

KHRUSHCHEV:
He said “all of you”.

MALENKOV:
I was behind him. He went (gestures)

“all of you”.

KHRUSHCHEV:
"All of you".

MALENKOV:
No. "All of you".

KAGANOVICH:
(demonstrates)

He said:

MALENKOV:
All of YOU can kiss MY arse! Get nme the girl, I’m going onto the balcony.
152 EXT. KREMLIN - BALCONY - NIGHT 152
Malenkov steps onto a balcony with the girl. Because he doesn’t lift her up, we can hardly see her.

CUT TO:
153 EXT./INT. OPEN SPACE SURROUNDED BY WOODLAND/CAR - EARLY 153

MORNING:
Two cars parked, with their drivers some distance away. Kaganovich and Khrushchev lean against one of the cars.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Who will the people blame? Me or Beria? Who looks like he’s got blood on his boots?

KAGANOVICH:
(you?)
Oh, Beria. People will definitely blame Beria.

MOLOTOV:
MURDERER!
Molotov approaches on foot, with a small dog.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 111. MOLOTOV   
You’ve killed hundreds, Nicky! You

certainly got your big funeral!

KHRUSHCHEV:
I regret this already..

MOLOTOV:
(interrupts) Get in the car.

KHRUSHCHEV:
What?

MOLOTOV:
Can’t talk. Get in the car.
Khrushchev and Kaganovich share a look – then get in. Molotov pulls his dog in too.

KAGANOVICH:
(RE dog)
I see she moults.
Molotov takes out a cuddly toy. The dog starts barking - loud, irritating - and jumping up, trying to grab it.

MOLOTOV:
This–
(waves the cuddly toy again, to more barks)
–is for any hungry ears...

KHRUSHCHEV:
The car isn’t bugged. We’d see wires stretching to Moscow.

MOLOTOV:
(looks out)
The drivers. So... (close, menacing) Let’s do him in.

KHRUSHCHEV:
What?

MOLOTOV:
(vigorously shakes the

toy)
Beria. The treacherous snake brought back the Bishops. And he brought back Polina. He expressly ignored Stalin’s orders. The man has no soul. He ordered his men to open fire. Genius, Nicky.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 112.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(just about keeping up with Molotov’s logic)
Yes, Beria’s the murderer here...

KAGANOVICH:
Those who were killed must not die in vain...

MOLOTOV:
This is how the Soviet Union was built. Not with Bishops. Today, Beria gets an eight-foot crucifix up his arse!
The dog's still yapping.

KAGANOVICH:
I've had nightmares that make more sense than this.

MOLOTOV:
The people who died are martyrs. You have to do it in...
The dog has stopped barking. Molotov waves the toy again and it jumps and barks.

KAGANOVICH:
Please. Can this fucking DOG be a martyr?

MOLOTOV:
You have to do it in one go. Bang! Like in '36. Won't be easy though.

KHRUSHCHEV:

Zhukhov’s already got the army sharpening their bayonets...

KAGANOVICH:
And it’s got to be today. Only time the army’s in the capital.

MOLOTOV:
Excellent. I’m in!

KHRUSHCHEV:
Good, good. We have a majority!

MOLOTOV:
Yes!

KAGANOVICH:
You two, me, Bulganin...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 113.

MOLOTOV:
(cuts in)
You need Malenkov and Mikoyan too.

KHRUSHCHEV:
But... why?

MOLOTOV:
It's what Stalin would have wanted. The Committee, as one! Act fast Comrade. Act fast or be dead.
(to dog)
YES. Uncle Nicky’s going to be dead if he doesn’t get a move on, isn’t he? Oh yes he is. Yes he is...

CUT TO:
154 INT. MAUSOLEUM - DAY 154
The committee, dignitaries, generals, Svetlana, Mezhnikov and Kobulov wait in formal dress. The guarded coffin is nearby.
Khrushchev watches uneasily as Malenkov jokes with Beria. Svetlana comes close.

SVETLANA:

You promised to protect me and my family...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Of course. Always, my dearest most precious...

SVETLANA:
Well you didn’t.
She slips him the piece of paper Beria gave her, leaves. Beria and Zhukhov appear, surprising Khrushchev.

BERIA:
So. Comrade Zhukhov and I have been conferring...
Khrushchev looks appalled. Has he been betrayed?

ZHUKHOV:
All chums again now, eh? Onward!

BERIA:
He's come up with a plan for Vasily's speech.

ZHUKHOV:
It will go ahead but it “may” coincide with the fly-past.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 114.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(flooded with relief)
Hah! Excellent! That’s an excellent idea! Zhukhov! The genius!

ZHUKHOV:
Let's give the old maniac the sendoff he deserves.
A general sense of bonhomie. Beria puts his hand on Khrushchev - it's a reconciliation. He then pats Khrushchev’s trousers... Bang, it’s the tomato game again.
Zhukhov finds it funny. ZHUKHOV   
It’s what he would have wanted.
Kobulov gestures to Beria who goes over to him, leaving

Malenkov with Khrushchev.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Georgy...
A 21-gun salute begins outside – the signal for the funeral. KHRUSHCHEV   
We have to act today.

MALENKOV:
Let’s bury the old man first.
Khrushchev is about to reply but is interrupted by Mezhnikov.

MEZHNIKOV:
Comrades! Please take your places for the cortege.
Khrushchev and his allies take their places around the coffin. Beria and Malenkov are at the front, next to Khrushchev. Zhukhov is directly behind him.

ZHUKHOV:
3..2..
Malenkov joins in, as before, expecting Zhukhov to allow him to command the moment.
ZHUKHOV/MALENKOV
..1...

ZHUKHOV:
Lift!

MALENKOV:
Yes, lift, everyone.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 115.
Everyone lifts and tries to get comfortable. Some have a shoulder under it, others just a hand. They start walking the coffin forward towards the open door as a cannon fires every few seconds.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Malenkov) Georgy! Georgy!
155 EXT. RED SQUARE - EMERGING FROM THE MAUSOLEUM - DAY 155 (CONTINUOUS)
They shuffle out into a solemn Red Square, packed with mourners. Zhukhov still pressing Khrushchev.

ZHUKHOV:
Is Malenkov on board?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Georgy’s in. One hundred per cent.

ZHUKHOV:
All or nothing now, Nicky, eh?
They are now in full view of the crowd. The pall-bearers shift the coffin on into the mausoleum, helped by some SOLDIERS. Zhukhov takes a step back and salutes.
We see an extreme long shot of Zhukhov saluting. His eyes flick upwards. He knows he's being watched.
A colonel with bushy eyebrows - BREZHNEV, on a Red Square rooftop, puts down his binoculars.
Khrushchev nods at Bulganin and Kaganovich: it's happening.

CUT TO:
156 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY - DAY 156
The balcony on top of Lenin's mausoleum. The committee members and dignitaries are stood in a line.

MOLOTOV:
(struggling, in tears)
Stalin's love of ...love of the nation... The people's pain... The pain of the people... Oh...
We pan along legs. Chalk marks - initials of who's to stand where. A technician crouches out of view. Khrushchev's foot scratches an itch on his calf.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 116.
157 INT. CORRIDOR FROM MAUSOLEUM TO KREMLIN - DAY 157
Brezhnev and MOSKALENKO walk with briefcases towards some NKVD MEN by a set of double doors. An NKVD lieutenant, Pervak salutes them. They show papers, hand over pistols, go inside.
158 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY - DAY 158
Malenkov’s delivery is incredibly dull.

MALENKOV:
Yet we will draw strength from the continuity of the revolution as it goes on an on, generation after

generation... yet today we pause in grief, and sorrow. But is not a pause in itself part of the revolution...?
Beria looks bored. Others sway to keep warm.
159 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS - DAY 159
Pictures of Stalin and Lenin. Brezhnev closes the door. Both men open up their briefcases to reveal wires, a small red light bulb, electrical equipment.
160 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY 160
Vasily is now at the microphone. He shouts into it.

VASILY:
My father was a great social scientist! But we, the people of the Soviet Union, are not laboratory animals! No! We are laboratory technicians!
The very noisy fly-over begins. He tries to shout over it. VASILY   
My father! Your father! Our father!
161 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS - DAY 161
Moskalenko fixes the lightbulb to a window frame. Brezhnev trails a wire along the edge of the skirting board towards a set of double-doors into a larger meeting room, with chairs around a long oak table.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 117.
162 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY - DAY 162
Beria speaking, Malenkov and Khrushchev on either side.

BERIA:
We must embrace our terrible loss with the strength and love for our nation that Stalin himself..
163 INT./EXT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 163
Moskalenko hammers a wedge into the window frame, checks it’s jammed shut, as NKVD GUARDS listen to Beria's speech in a courtyard outside, their backs to the window.
Brezhnev fastens a button underneath the table, checks a wire leading down the table leg and under the carpet. He puts a place card - “Comrade General Secretary Malenkov" at the head of the table, where the button is.
164 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY - DAY 164
Beria continues his speech.

BERIA:
We now carry forward the torch of revolution. I applaud the Central Committee, who have declared Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov President and General Secretary...
165 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS/MEETING ROOM - DAY 165
Brezhnev presses the button under the table. Moskalenko is by the red bulb. It lights up.
166 EXT. MAUSOLEUM - BALCONY - DAY 166
The committee members are feeling the cold.

BERIA:
..We promise you rights and liberties, bread and peace.
Everyone in the crowd applauds. A bit too much for Malenkov.
167 EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY 167
The view from the balcony of Red Square - the applauding crowd, the flags, the banners and portraits.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 118.
168 INT. KREMLIN CORRIDOR/MEETING ROOM - DAY 168
Beria walks cheerfully with Molotov, followed by the PRESIDIUM MEMBERS, Zhukhov - in army greatcoat - then Khrushchev and Malenkov.

BERIA:
"Bread and peace". I knew it would work. It was between "peace" and "sausages".
The generals and ZHUKHOV reach the NKVD guards at the door.

PERVAK:
Forgive me, comrades. Your weapons.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I think we can rely on the liberators of Berlin to use their weapons appropriately.
Khrushchev peels off. KHRUSHCHEV   
Just going to freshen my trousers.
169 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS - DAY 169
Khrushchev heads into the toilet. Brezhnev and his men are

all there, waiting quietly. Nobody says anything. Khrushchev pulls out Svetlana’s Yuri note, soiled with tomato.

CUT TO:
170 INT. KREMLIN CORRIDOR/MEETING ROOM - DAY 170
Khrushchev catches up with Malenkov in the corridor ahead of the meeting room.
Khrushchev discreetly hands Malenkov Svetlana's note.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Beria gave this to Svetlana. Let her know what you did to Zhednov. See? He’d shit on all of us.
Malenkov grows pale. He quickly puts the paper in his pocket.

MALENKOV:
The snake. Alright.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 119.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I'll bring up the emergency motion. There's a button under the desk at your end. You hit it. Yes?
Malenkov nods, nervously.

MALENKOV:
Yes. But just a demotion.
171 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS - DAY 171
Zhukhov enters the toilet. Opens his coat to reveal Kalashnikovs. Brezhnev smiles. A presidium member walks in to go to the toilet.
PRESIDIUM MEMBER
I didn’t do any...
A hand is clamped over the Presidium member's mouth.
172 INT./EXT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 172
Malenkov is at the head of the table, Beria near the window. Outside, some NKVD GUARDS patrol the courtyard.

BERIA:
Malenkov.
Malenkov looks at him, unable to say anything. BERIA   
Let's start.

(still nothing. He takes over)
SHALL WE? Item One. The unfortunate events of yesterday evening...
Khrushchev raises his hand. Malenkov doesn't acknowledge him. BERIA   
It is clear that the regrettable deaths of many citizens hastening to the capital...
Khrushchev thrusts his hand even higher, glares at Malenkov. BERIA   
...had several local causes...

MALENKOV:
Er, Comrade Khrushchev has the floor...
Beria, perplexed, looks at Malenkov, who avoids his gaze.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 120.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Comrades, I propose a new Agenda Item One. “The conduct of Comrade Beria”.

BERIA:
Can anyone else hear that barking dog? I’ve lost my thread now...
Malenkov just stares at the table in front of him.

KHRUSHCHEV:
I accuse Comrade Beria of centralising power within his Ministry at the expense of the Party and the Central Committee. Of betraying the Soviet Union to capitalist interests...

BERIA:
(to everyone)
I warn you, Nicky. This petulant Wild West stuff will end very badly.

KHRUSHCHEV:

(indicating button) Georgy! Georgy!
Malenkov just stares forward, unable to move.

BERIA:
Comrades, Perhaps there is concern at the speed of our reforms. But really, THIS nonsense?
Khrushchev leaps up, rushes round to the button and hits it hard, knocking Malenkov out of the way.
BERIA   
Arrest this madman! He’s out of control!
173 INT. KREMLIN - TOILETS - DAY 173
The red light bulb lights up.

ZHUKHOV:
Good luck, ladies!
174 INT./EXT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 174
Soldiers burst into the room, led by Zhukhov.

ZHUKHOV:
Hands in the air!
20 May 2016 Draft 10 121.
Beria puts the palm of his hand on the window. The NKVD guards are too far away to see it.
175 EXT. KREMLIN - COURTYARD - DAY 175
On Beria’s palm, he's written: "ALERT".
176 INT./EXT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 176
Zhukhov points his weapon at Beria.

ZHUKHOV:
Hands in the air or bullet in the fucking face!
Malenkov’s hands go up. Khrushchev slaps them down in disbelief.

BERIA:
(banging on window) GUARDS!!...
Zhukhov hits him in the face with his rifle butt. Beria drops to the ground, his pince-nez fly off. Zhukhov gets in close.

ZHUKHOV:

See? You want a job done properly, send for the army.
He frisks Beria. The other soldiers keep their guns on him.

MALENKOV:
He's got a knife by his ankle.
Beria stares at Malenkov, who starts to cry.
177 INT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM - DAY 177
Beria is handcuffed on a chair, his face a bloodied mess.

BERIA:
Georgy...
Malenkov, sat across the room, looks ashamed.

KHRUSHCHEV:
(to Malenkov) Say nothing.

ZHUKHOV:
Remove his belt. It's hard for a man to escape when his trousers are falling down.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 122.

MIKOYAN:
Leave the man some dignity, please. That suit without a belt would be a disaster!

BERIA:
Gentlemen, rest assured I sense the strength of feeling in the room.

ZHUKHOV:
Shut up, you fucking tumour.

MOLOTOV:
That man is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents...

MALENKOV:
We all are...

BERIA:
Exactly. Collective guilt.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Comrades, please...

MALENKOV:
What happens now?
Zhukhov mimes shooting Beria.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Zhukhov!
(to Malenkov)
We wait for Red Square to empty of NKVD...

ZHUKHOV:
Then I give the signal and we roll this barrel of shit out.
The doors burst open. It's Kobulov and 2 NKVD lieutenants and Pervak, armed and carrying trays of sandwiches and cold meats.
They freeze. Everyone turns and looks at them. Zhukhov clamps his hand over Beria’s mouth.

KOBULOV:
Sorry, comrades. Wrong room.
They turn to go. Beria tries to call after them.

ZHUKHOV:
Those sandwiches were curling up anyway.
(to Beria)
Your lot can’t even do CATERING.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 123. (MORE)
(to room) Let’s go.
178 EXT. KREMLIN - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY 178
Several trucks and armoured cars drive up. Soldiers leap out and surround the NKVD, who raise their weapons. An army COLONEL walks over to an NKVD OFFICER. The NKVD officer gestures for the NKVD to lower their guns.
The colonel hurries inside, followed by his men, guns cocked.

179 INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 179
The middle-aged man arrested earlier is playing chess with his son. All is forgiven. The NKVD burst in.

WIFE:
No! NO! He didn't mean anything!
The NKVD march over to the son, grab him and head out.
180 INT. KREMLIN - CORRIDORS/STORE CUPBOARD - DAY 180
The colonel and his men walk through. Kobulov spots them. Dives into a store-cupboard. The men head in after him. We hear shots.
181 INT. BERIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 181
Vasily lies on the bed in his ceremonial uniform, drinking. The door is opened by an NKVD OFFICER, who steps to one side. An army GENERAL, a CAPTAIN and two SOLDIERS enter.
The soldiers aim their rifles at Vasily.

VASILY:
No! NO! You can't!...
The general fires his pistol into the wall by Vasily's head. VASILY   
You nearly fucking killed me and now I’m DEAF! You hear me, I’m DEAF!
The captain hauls Vasily up, tears off his epaulets, his medals, buttons. He's been disgraced. They drag him out. VASILY   
Do you know who I am? Do you know who YOU are? Who the fuck are you?
20 May 2016 Draft 10 124. ZHUKHOV (CONT'D)
182 INT. BERIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 182
Some NKVD OFFICERS and Beria's terrified STAFF are being marched out at gunpoint by a group of soldiers.
Vasily's dragged into the living room.
The frightened teenage girl is hauled out of the hidden room. MARIA is also taken out of another locked room.
183 INT./EXT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY 183
Zhukhov peeks through the curtains. The NKVD have been replaced by Red Army SOLDIERS. Zhukhov moves across to Beria and stands him up. Takes off his belt.

ZHUKHOV:
OK, Judy Garland. Let’s go.

He hauls him forward. Beria's trousers start to fall. Brezhnev pulls them up for him and Beria grabs them.

BERIA:
If we could discuss this rationally...

ZHUKHOV:
(that’s a good idea) You’re right. We should... (gags Beria)
“Ooh, what’s happening? My trousers are round my ankles but my cock’s not inside an orphan...”
One of the newly-arrived soldiers hands Zhukhov a sack. He puts it over Beria's head.

MALENKOV:
Hey! Nicky! We agreed. A demotion.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Oh, it’s definitely THAT, wouldn’t you say?

MOLOTOV:
Remember when you took Polina away? How you must have enjoyed it. I’m certainly enjoying this, you cockroach.
Beria struggles. Zhukhov punches him in the gut. He folds but is held up by Moskalenko and Brezhnev. His trousers fall.
Brezhnev pulls up Beria's trousers, puts them in his hands.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 125.

BREZHNEV:
Hold them!...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(taunting Beria)
How’s the meeting going, would you say, COMRADE SACK? You're on a list now, fucker!

MALENKOV:

Stop this!...

KHRUSHCHEV:
I'M THE REFORMER!
Beria is led out the room, battling with his trousers. KHRUSHCHEV   
Roudenko is in the basement, along with Konev...

MIKOYAN:
You're putting him on trial? Now? I'm disgusted! And slightly impressed at your efficiency, Nikki.

MALENKOV:
This is all totally, totally, beyond any agenda...

MIKOYAN:
Listen to yourself. What do you think is happening here, Georgy? Should someone be taking minutes?

KHRUSHCHEV:
We have to act instantly... Molotov bangs the table.

MOLOTOV:
Bang! Over! Marxism-Leninism was born in flames! Let the fire of our vengeance consume all traitors and bastards!

MALENKOV:
No! I forbid it!...

MIKOYAN:
You want the NKVD to spring him from jail? Things’d get a bit lively then...

BULGANIN:
Nobody wants civil war.

20 May 2016 Draft 10 126.

KAGANOVICH:
He will kill us all...
Khrushchev tries to hand Malenkov a document.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Come on Georgy. Sign this or we’re all dead.

MALENKOV:
He deserves a trial! The man deserves a trial!...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(furious)
What about Tukhachevsky and Piatakov and Meyerhold and Mikhoels? Didn't they deserve a trial? And poor Sokolnikov. Who begged him to look after his elderly mother. That monster strangled her in front of him. I’ve killed a lot of people. I did it because it was my duty. That human turd killed for pleasure.
Khrushchev puts a brotherly hand on Malenkov’s shoulder. KHRUSHCHEV   
Georgy, we’ve gone too far now. The only choice we have is between his death or his revenge.
Malenkov looks at him, pale and dazed.

MALENKOV:
I'm General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

KHRUSHCHEV:
That's right. You are.
He hands him the document and a pen. Malenkov signs it.
184 EXT. KREMLIN - BACK AREA - DAY 184
From a distance we see the generals and Brezhnev dragging Beria. His trousers fall and he trips.

185 INT. KREMLIN - WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY 185
A bleak space. An improvised courtroom.
On a raised stage: ROUDENKO, mid-40s in a judge's gown. Next to him, Marshall KONEV.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 127.
The Presidium and Committee members are there with senior PARTY AND MILITARY OFFICIALS. Armed SOLDIERS everywhere.
Zhukhov, Moskalenko and Brezhnev walk Beria to the improvised dock. Zhukhov removes the sack and gag.

BERIA:
You are all witnesses to a criminal travesty! Think what you like! You are STILL witnesses!
Konev keeps banging. BERIA   
I demand my rights under, under... article 43 of the... Stop banging, I demand to be heard! We are not savages!

KHRUSHCHEV:
YOU are! YOU are!

BERIA:
(weakening, to Malenkov) Georgy... Our wives... what will you tell your wife? And mine? The children?

KONEV:
Comrade General Secretary...
Trembling, Malenkov looks to Khrushchev who nods. Malenkov tries to read out a statement.

MALENKOV:
"Lavrenti Pavolovich Beria..."

BERIA:
You fucking traitor...

MALENKOV:
"Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria. You are accused..."

Malenkov stops. He looks like he's going to faint.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Fucks sake!
(taking the document) "You are accused of using
your position as Minister of the Interior to plot against the Soviet Union with the goal of forwarding the interests of foreign powers..."

BERIA:
(at same time)
I am a Marshall of the Soviet Union, a member of...
20 May 2016 Draft 10 128.

BERIA:
Foreign powers! Which ones? The fucking MOON?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(over Beria)
"You are also accused of 347 counts of rape, of sexual deviancy and bourgeois immorality, of acts of perversion with children as young as 7 years old...

BERIA:
Ah. Everyone in this ROOM is responsible for someone’s death. So let’s find something exotic for old Beria.
Beria stops protesting, completely knocked. He spots Svetlana, her eyes full of hate.
BERIA   
Svetushka...

KHRUSHCHEV:
(reading as quickly as he can)

...including the rapes of Luba Dolomaya, aged 12, Petra Nikova, 13
...

BERIA:
YOU ARE THE RAPISTS! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!
Khrushchev skips ahead, trying to shout over Beria.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Anna Laranskaya, Nadia Ranova...etc etc... Magya Holovic...treason... anti-Soviet behaviour...er, the court finds you guilty and sentences you to be taken to Lubyanka prison and shot...

BERIA:
NO! NIKITA! I'M YOUR FRIEND!!

ZHUKHOV:
(whispers to Beria)
Shut it. Look, here’s “Exhibit A”.
Beria looks down. Zhukhov is holding a knife to his ribs. Beria suddenly loses it, starts screaming like a little girl. Khrushchev calmly waves goodbye.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 129.
Zhukhov, Brezhnev and some soldiers drag him outside. Chairs are knocked over, there are screams and shouts. It's chaos. They've got Beria as far as the doorway. A shot rings out.
Then another. More screams. A burst of sub-machine-gun fire. A shout of "CEASE-FIRE!"
186 INT. KREMLIN - WINDOWLESS ROOM DOORWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 186
Beria's body is in the doorway of the courtroom. He's riddled with bullets, bleeding heavily.
Svetlana spits on the body.

SVETLANA:
For Yuri. For my mother.
Zhukhov reaches into Beria's mouth and pulls out a tooth.

ZHUKHOV:
(off their looks) Nearly a full set now.

187 EXT. KREMLIN - BACK AREA - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 187
Beria’s body is hauled out by SOLDIERS. They dump it unceremoniously, douse it with petrol and set fire to it. Everyone emerges from the building, registering the burning corpse with varying levels of coolness. They’ve seen some brutal things.
But Svetlana is shocked, and moves away from the group. She looks like she may throw up.
Khrushchev is now the centre of gravity. Everyone wants to be in orbit around him. Grim wordless exchanges. Kaganovich is close

KHRUSHCHEV:
Now we can turn the corner. Put the bloodshed behind us.
ANGLE on Malenkov. He looks bereaved. KHRUSHCHEV   
I worry about Malenkov though. Can we trust him?

KAGANOVICH:
Can you ever trust a weak man?
Khrushchev agrees. They can’t. He spots Svetlana, walks over to her. Kaganovich acting as informal bouncer, keeping everyone else away.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 130.

SVETLANA:
I’m scared.

KHRUSHCHEV:
There’s no need.

SVETLANA:
I don’t know where...

KHRUSHCHEV:
Vasily’s safe. I give you my word, Svetlana, I will look after him.
He hands her an envelope. KHRUSHCHEV   
Here is your passage to safety, too...

SVETLANA:
(re envelope contents) Vienna?

KHRUSHCHEV:
Vasily must stay. For his own safety. We can’t have a drunken madman spreading conspiracy theories all over the world...

SVETLANA:
I could...

KHRUSHCHEV:
No. He stays. You must go, for YOUR sake. There will be a reckoning here. Your...story may not fit. One of these men might have to kill you...
She’s shocked. Khrushchev needs her to look at him. She does. KHRUSHCHEV   
I might have to kill you.
A stunned beat. Her bitter smile. She looks at Malenkov, Mikoyan, Bulganin...

SVETLANA:
I never thought it would be you.

KHRUSHCHEV:
Safe travels, Svetlana.
A bow, he rejoins the group. Someone has produced vodka. The corpse burns on.
20 May 2016 Draft 10 131. KHRUSHCHEV   
Now we can turn the corner. Put the bloodshed behind us.
They place a large electric fan next to the bin. KHRUSHCHEV   
I worry about Malenkov though. Can we trust him?

KAGANOVICH:
Can you ever trust a weak man?

KHRUSHCHEV:
(nods agreement) No...
He turns the fan on and tips the ashes out. We watch the ashes dispel in the wind.

CUT TO:
188 INT. RADIO MOSCOW - MAIN AUDITORIUM 188
Maria is playing a Mozart piano concerto.

CLOSING CARDS:
1) AFTER BERIA'S EXECUTION IN 1953, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOOK CONTROL OF THE SOVIET UNION
2) IN 1956 KHRUSHCHEV MOVED TO DEMOTE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, INCLUDING MOLOTOV AND MALENKOV
We pan up to a box, where we see Khrushchev smiling, in his element. Nina and some sycophants sit around him.
We see Andreyev and Sergei in the control room. Something to suggest Andreyev’s living in a new reality too - more anxious, surrounded by new equipment? Or more confident, bullying?
3) AT LONG LAST, HE BECAME HEAD OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
We stay on Khrushchev smiling. A young Brezhnev is behind him.
4) UNTIL HIS REMOVAL IN 1964 BY LEONID BREZHNEV

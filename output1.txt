7. Longest Sentence Length: 96
   Longest Sentence: "Accepting 10 bar pressure drop with lower AR allows to decrease of about 20 − 30 K the maximum wall temperature , which is now about 650 K for the case without coolant bypass in the main cooling system and 790 K for the case where 1.66 kg/s of fuel bypass 3.2 Nozzle extension cooling To keep the thrust chamber in a safe range of wall temperature ( below 800 K ) , the exit flow temperature from the main cooling system is still too low compared to that assumed in the basic system analysis ."
